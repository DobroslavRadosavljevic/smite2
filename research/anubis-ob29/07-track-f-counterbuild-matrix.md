# Track F: Anubis Counterbuild Swap Matrix (Mode-Specific)

Generated: 2026-02-25 (UTC)

## Evidence baseline

- This matrix is grounded in SMITE 2 Wiki pages for Anubis kit mechanics, item effects, and Arena vs Conquest mode structure.
- Anubis context that matters for swaps:
  - `Plague of Locusts` is channeled; Anubis is displacement immune but self-slowed while channeling.
  - `Death Gaze` is CC immune while active, but Anubis is rooted while channeling.
  - Passive (`The Scales`) grants lifesteal and protections that scale as HP drops, so surviving first burst often decides whether you can stabilize and heal back.
- Mode context that changes swap timing:
  - Arena is shorter and faster (avg ~15-20 min, starts at level 3 with 1,250 gold, fight-heavy ticket mode).
  - Conquest is longer (avg ~25-45 min) with lane/jungle objective phases and stronger emphasis on Gold Fury/Fire Giant windows.

## Matchup-driven swap matrix

| Counter theme | Enemy draft signal | Conquest swap plan | Arena swap plan | Why this works (wiki-verified) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anti-heal | 2+ high-heal threats (healer core, lifesteal frontliners, sustain comps) | Force **Divine Ruin** by item 3-4; accelerate to item 2-3 if first objective fights are sustain-losing. | Buy **Divine Ruin** earlier (often item 2-3) because 5v5 uptime is near-constant. | **Divine Ruin** applies **25% Healing Reduction for 5s** on god damage, and its chain lightning can re-apply anti-heal across nearby targets. |
| Anti-tank | Double frontline, high protections, tanks surviving full combo | Pair **Soul Reaver** + **Obsidian Shard** by midgame; add **Sundering Arc** when objective/frontline true damage value is high. | Prioritize **Soul Reaver** then **Obsidian Shard** earlier than Conquest when enemy frontline is perma-front-to-back. | **Soul Reaver** adds ability-hit bonus damage scaling with target health; **Obsidian Shard** grants **35% Penetration**; **Sundering Arc** applies true-damage bleed. |
| Anti-dive | Assassins/warriors repeatedly reaching you before second cast | Add peel tool first: **Gem of Isolation** for ability slow uptime, then **Phantom Shell** when auto-attack divers are the main problem. Flex **Breastplate of Valor** if dives are sustained. | Shift anti-dive one item earlier than Conquest. Arena fight density rewards early **Gem of Isolation** and faster **Phantom Shell** timing. | **Gem of Isolation** applies **15% Slow for 2s** on damaging ability hit; **Phantom Shell** gives team shield + reduced attack damage taken and wall/player pass-through; **Breastplate** adds protections + cooldown rate and cooldown refund on HP loss. |
| Anti-CC | Reliable hard-CC chain interrupting channel setups | Prioritize **Purification Beads**, then choose **Magi's Cloak** (single key CC denial) or **Spirit Robe** (repeat chain-CC survivability). | Treat anti-CC as mandatory earlier: **Beads** first into heavy control, and upgrade to **Talisman of Purification** sooner for repeated 5v5 cleanse value. | **Purification Beads** gives 2s CC immunity; **Magi's Cloak** provides a hard-CC bubble every 90s with 1.5s immunity on pop; **Spirit Robe** grants protections + heal-over-time after hard CC; **Talisman** cleanses nearby allies and grants brief CC immunity. |
| Anti-burst | You die before combo completion or before ult channel value | Run **Aegis of Acceleration** into **Time-lock Aegis** when one-shot patterns are deciding fights; add **Shifter's Shield** as defensive flex if still dying through relics. | Buy anti-burst earlier than Conquest because Arena's constant skirmishes and hot-streak damage swings punish greed. | **Aegis** gives temporary damage immunity; **Time-lock Aegis** extends immunity window and restores regen/cooldowns; **Shifter's Shield** adds protections under 75% HP. |

## Mode-specific swap order

- Conquest:
  - Keep your core damage curve intact for objective fights, then swap in counters as enemy win conditions appear.
  - Typical replacement order: `slot 6 -> slot 5 -> slot 4`.
- Arena:
  - Move counter tools one item earlier than your Conquest timing because the mode starts faster and teamfights are more frequent.
  - Typical replacement order: `slot 6 -> slot 5` early, then cut deeper only if still hard-countered.

## Fast decision rules

- If enemy sustain is deciding early fights, buy **Divine Ruin** immediately.
- If frontline survives your full ability cycle, prioritize **Soul Reaver/Obsidian Shard** before more flat damage.
- If divers consistently reach you during channel windows, slot **Gem of Isolation** and/or **Phantom Shell** now.
- If one CC source repeatedly cancels your kill setup, prioritize **Beads -> Magi's/Talisman** before greed damage.
- If you are dying pre-second cast, convert a damage slot into **Shifter's Shield** or commit to **Aegis -> Time-lock Aegis**.
