# Thanatos (SMITE 2) OB29 Research Pack

Generated: 2026-02-25 (UTC)

## Short answer: best builds by mode (OB29)

### Conquest (Jungle) - highest-confidence meta build

1. Starter: **Bumba's Cudgel** -> **Bumba's Hammer**
2. Slot 1: **Hydra's Lament**
3. Slot 2: **Jotunn's Revenge**
4. Slot 3: **Heartseeker**
5. Slot 4: **Titan's Bane**
6. Slot 5: **The Crusher**
7. Slot 6: **The Reaper**
8. Relic default: **Blink Rune**

Confidence: **0.85 (High)**

### Arena - best current practical build (OB29-adjusted)

1. Starter: **Bumba's Cudgel** -> **Bumba's Hammer**
2. Slot 1: **Hydra's Lament**
3. Slot 2: **Jotunn's Revenge**
4. Slot 3: **The Reaper**
5. Slot 4: **Heartseeker**
6. Slot 5: **Titan's Bane**
7. Slot 6: **Bloodforge**
8. Relic default: **Blink Rune** (or **Purification Beads** into heavy CC)

Confidence: **0.68 (Medium)**  
Reason: there is no clean OB29 dedicated Thanatos Arena build feed with the same quality as Conquest data, so Arena is an evidence-backed adaptation.

## Why these are the current best shells

- It matches Thanatos's execute-reset burst identity.
- It aligns with current OB29 role/item changes.
- Conquest has stronger direct source convergence.
- Arena uses OB29 item context plus multi-mode historical Thanatos builds.

## Important caveat

There is no fully transparent official public pro-only Thanatos build dataset available in this pass, so these are evidence-backed best meta recommendations, not mathematically absolute answers for every lobby.
