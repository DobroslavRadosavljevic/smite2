## Meta-relevant system and item changes

### OB29 key changes that affect Thanatos build logic

- Jungle role buff: `+35%` jungle monster damage.
- Jungle kill role sustain: heal and mana return on jungle monster kill.
- Bumba line shifted away from jungle-only damage/sustain behavior.
- Adaptive item stat selection logic updated.
- Brawler's Beat Stick nerf in raw stats.
- Blinking Abyss nerfed.
- Death Metal reworked.

### OB28 and OB27 carry-over context

- OB28: Brawler's Beat Stick reworked into anti-heal plus in-combat stacking profile.
- OB27: Heartseeker nerf, The Crusher nerf, Jotunn's Revenge buff, The Reaper nerf, Arondight buff.

## Practical interpretation for Thanatos

- Clear and sustain baseline moved more into role passives and less into old jungle-only item behavior.
- Pen + burst + cooldown remains core to Thanatos execution windows.
- Anti-heal is still useful, but Brawler is less efficient as a pure damage slot in OB29.
- High-value burst proc tools remain strong, but should be weighed against survivability and matchup needs.
- Conquest gets extra value from role buffs (officially Conquest-only).
- Arena does not get Conquest role buffs, so itemized sustain and kill-chain survivability matter relatively more.
