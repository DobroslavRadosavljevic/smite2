# Best Builds (OB29): Conquest and Arena

## 1) Conquest (Jungle): absolute best default build

1. Starter: **Bumba's Cudgel** -> **Bumba's Hammer**
2. **Hydra's Lament**
3. **Jotunn's Revenge**
4. **Heartseeker**
5. **Titan's Bane**
6. **The Crusher**
7. **The Reaper**
8. Relic: **Blink Rune**

Why this is the top Conquest default:

- Direct OB29 Thanatos build convergence from current-patch sources.
- Strongest fit for Thanatos execute-reset identity.
- Keeps power curve on Strength, cooldown flow, and penetration timing.

Confidence: **0.85 (High)**

## 2) Arena: best current practical build (OB29-adjusted)

1. Starter: **Bumba's Cudgel** -> **Bumba's Hammer**
2. **Hydra's Lament**
3. **Jotunn's Revenge**
4. **The Reaper**
5. **Heartseeker**
6. **Titan's Bane**
7. **Bloodforge**
8. Relic: **Blink Rune** (or **Purification Beads** into heavy CC)

Why this is the current best Arena recommendation:

- OB29 Bumba line now procs around enemy hits instead of being jungle-only, which improves non-Conquest value.
- Arena has constant brawls, so **The Reaper + Bloodforge** gives stronger kill-chain sustain/commit windows.
- Retains core Thanatos burst/pen shell from proven Conquest builds.

Confidence: **0.68 (Medium)**

## 3) Mode-specific variants

### Conquest snowball variant

1. Starter: **Bumba's Spear** route
2. **Arondight**
3. **Hydra's Lament**
4. **The Reaper**
5. **Heartseeker**
6. **Titan's Bane**
7. **Bloodforge**

Use when:

- You can force early leads and repeated picks.
- Enemy backline has weak peel.

### Arena safer sustain variant

1. Starter: **Death's Toll** -> **Death's Embrace**
2. **Hydra's Lament**
3. **Jotunn's Revenge**
4. **The Reaper**
5. **Titan's Bane**
6. **Heartseeker**
7. **Bloodforge**

Use when:

- You need more consistent health sustain through extended poking phases.
- Your team needs you to re-enter multiple fights, not just one-shot.

## 4) Relic defaults

- **Conquest:** Blink Rune default, Beads into high hard-CC comps.
- **Arena:** Blink Rune if you can flank safely; Beads first if enemy CC chain is reliable.

## 5) Build certainty notes

- Conquest build has strong OB29 convergence.
- Arena build is an evidence-backed adaptation from OB29 item context plus older multi-mode Thanatos data.
- No dedicated high-trust OB29 Thanatos Arena-only feed was available in this run.
