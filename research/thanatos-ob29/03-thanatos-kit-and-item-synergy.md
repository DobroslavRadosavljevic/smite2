# Thanatos Kit and Item Synergy

## Core identity from wiki data

- Role: **Jungle**
- Damage profile: physical, burst, execute/reset assassin
- Resource model: abilities consume health, not mana

## Key kit mechanics driving itemization

- Passive (`Harvester of Souls`):
  - God kill heal: `15%` of max HP
  - NPC kill heal: `10%` of max HP
  - God kill cooldown reduction: `-5s`
- Ability 1 (`Death Scythe`):
  - High scaling poke and setup
  - Bonus % max-health damage vs gods
  - Heals Thanatos on hit damage
- Ability 2 (`Scent of Death`):
  - Move speed + flat penetration + bonus damage window
- Ability 3 (`Soul Reap`):
  - Burst cone + silence
- Ultimate (`Hovering Death`):
  - Execute threshold and high pick pressure

## What this means for items

- Strength scaling is premium.
- Penetration has direct value due execute setup and tank breakpoints.
- Cooldown supports reset chaining from passive kill CDR.
- Sustain and fight-continuation value are meaningful because abilities cost health.

## Core item mechanics (wiki-verified)

### The Crusher

- 50 Strength
- 15 Cooldown Rate
- Ability-hit physical damage passive scaling from Strength

### Titan's Bane

- 40 Strength
- Shattering effect: +35% penetration
- Does not stack with itself

### Heartseeker

### The Reaper

- 55 Strength

### Bumba's Cudgel -> Bumba's Hammer

- Cudgel: adaptive Strength/Intelligence, ability-into-basic true damage proc, cooldown refund on proc hit
- Hammer: stronger true damage proc, more cooldown refund, plus heal on proc hit
- Practical value: directly rewards Thanatos's ability -> basic weave pattern in both burst and reset chains

### Bloodforge

- 45 Strength
- 7.5% lifesteal
- Active gives a health shield window; kill interactions reduce active cooldown
- Practical value: stronger commit insurance in frequent teamfight modes (especially Arena)

## Aspect note

- `Aspect of Reaping` changes sustain profile and adds max-health scaling value on Soul Reap.
- It can work, but current external meta evidence does not show a universal always-on requirement.
