# Practical Gameplans and Swaps (Conquest vs Arena)

## Conquest gameplan

### Early game

1. Abuse strong jungle clear timing and early gank pressure.
2. Force relics with scythe poke and silence setup.
3. Convert first pick into objective tempo, then snowball resets.

### Mid game

1. Play fog and flank angles, not front-to-back face checks.
2. Prioritize carries, then execute threshold frontliners.
3. Reset quickly after kill; avoid over-committing for second engage without cooldowns.

### Late game

1. Keep one survival adaptation if enemy peel is heavy.
2. Treat relic timers as your commit gate.
3. If burst window fails, disengage and re-enter on cooldowns.

## Arena gameplan

### Early game

1. Trade around your scythe hit-confirm, not random all-ins.
2. Play side angles to avoid frontline CC walls.
3. Build toward kill-chain sustain earlier than in Conquest.

### Mid game

1. Enter fights after enemy hard-CC is spent.
2. Use execute pressure to force disengages even before finishing kills.
3. Reposition aggressively after each pick to keep ticket pressure.

### Late game

1. You are a finisher, not a primary tank engager.
2. Hold relic for guaranteed execute windows or anti-burst response.
3. Prioritize safe kill confirms over deep isolated dives.

## Universal swap matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Typical swap out |
|---|---|---|
| High healing/sustain | Brawler's Beat Stick, Contagion, anti-heal relic line | The Crusher or Bloodforge |
| Double tank / high HP frontline | Titan's Bane (mandatory), The Executioner | Bloodforge first, then flex damage slot |
| Crit / auto-attack heavy | Spectral Armor, Hide of the Nemean Lion | Bloodforge or The Crusher |
| Heavy hard-CC chain | Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe, Mantle of Discord | Bloodforge or The Crusher |
| You get blown up before second rotation | Shifter's Shield, Oni Hunter's Garb, Prophetic Cloak | Last greedy damage slot |

## Mode-specific replacement rule

- **Conquest:** replace in order `slot 6 -> slot 5 -> slot 4`; keep core penetration timing intact.
- **Arena:** replace in order `slot 6 -> slot 5`; keep your sustain pair (`Reaper` + one survival tool) online.

## Decision shortcuts

- If enemy heal stack is online early: force anti-heal by item 3-4.
- If you cannot touch backline through peel: buy one anti-CC/survival slot immediately.
- If tanks are unkillable at midgame fights: advance Titan's Bane timing one slot earlier.
