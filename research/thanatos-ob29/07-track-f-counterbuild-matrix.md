# Track F: Thanatos Counterbuild Swap Matrix (Matchup-Driven)

Generated: 2026-02-25 (UTC)

## Evidence baseline

- This matrix is built from SMITE 2 Wiki item pages first, then mapped to mode pacing differences from the Arena/Conquest wiki pages.
- Thanatos context that matters for counterbuilds:
  - He spends Health to cast abilities.
  - `Death Scythe` heals him for 50% of total damage dealt.
  - `Scent of Death` gives flat Penetration (8 -> 24 by rank).
- Practical implication: when you are being peeled or burst before a second rotation, one defensive flex slot is usually higher value than another pure damage item.

## Matchup-driven swap matrix

| Counter theme | Enemy draft signal | Conquest swap plan | Arena swap plan | Why this works (wiki-verified) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anti-heal | 2+ heal/sustain threats (dedicated healer, heavy lifesteal frontliner, reset comps) | Force **Brawler’s Beat Stick** by item 3-4; if enemy sustain is mostly lifesteal-on-you, add **Contagion** as your flex defensive slot. Usually cut last greed slot first. | Buy **Brawler’s Beat Stick** earlier (item 2-3) because fights are constant; add **Contagion** sooner if bruisers repeatedly lifesteal off you. | **Brawler’s Beat Stick** applies **25% Healing Reduction for 5s** on god damage; effect does not stack with similar effects. **Contagion** punishes lifesteal patterns by stacking on hits and consuming stacks for % max-health AoE damage. |
| Anti-tank | Double frontline, high protections, long fights around objectives | Lock **Titan’s Bane** no later than item 4-5; pair with **Heartseeker** for %max-health ability pressure. Add **The Executioner** only if you can reliably weave basics into tanks. | Prioritize **Heartseeker + Titan’s Bane** as your anti-frontline core; consider **The Executioner** only in front-to-back games where you get repeated basic attack uptime. | **Titan’s Bane** grants **35% Penetration**. **Heartseeker** adds ability-hit damage based on enemy max health. **The Executioner** can shred up to **30% protections** at full stacks. |
| Anti-crit | Enemy carry commits to crit core (Rage/Deathbringer/Demon Blade) | Add **Spectral Armor** as first defensive flex (usually item 5-6) once crit is online. Optional second anti-basic layer: **Hide of the Nemean Lion** active if their carry is fed. | Build **Spectral Armor** earlier (often item 4-5) because crit uptime in 5v5 is near-constant; add **Hide of the Nemean Lion** when their ADC is the primary loss condition. | **Spectral Armor** reduces nearby enemies’ Attack Speed by 25% and Critical Strike damage by 25%. **Hide of the Nemean Lion** active reflects a large share of incoming attack damage. |
| Anti-CC | Reliable hard-CC chains stop your first engage (taunt/stun/root combos) | If one key CC is stopping commits, buy **Magi’s Cloak**. If chain CC keeps sticking, prefer **Spirit Robe** and prioritize **Purification Beads** (upgrade to **Talisman of Purification** later). | Treat anti-CC as mandatory earlier than Conquest: **Beads** first into heavy control, then **Magi’s Cloak** or **Spirit Robe** by midgame depending on whether you need first-hit immunity or post-CC survivability. | **Magi’s Cloak** gives a hard-CC bubble every 90s and 1.5s CC immunity when popped. **Spirit Robe** grants burst protections after hard CC and healing over the buff window. **Purification/Talisman** provides cleanse + CC immunity tools. |
| Anti-burst | You die before second ability cycle or before execute confirm | Slot **Shifter’s Shield** or **Prophetic Cloak** as first defensive pivot. If fights are decided by one enemy combo, run **Aegis of Acceleration** into **Time-lock Aegis**. | Buy one anti-burst tool by midgame if you are not surviving first commit: **Shifter’s Shield** for immediate dual-prot value, **Prophetic Cloak** for scaling mitigation, **Aegis** when burst is unavoidable. | **Shifter’s Shield** grants extra protections under 75% HP. **Prophetic Cloak** evolves into mitigation (6%, or 12% past protection threshold). **Aegis/Time-lock** gives temporary damage immunity windows to survive burst scripts. |

## Mode-specific swap order

- Conquest:
  - Keep your penetration timing intact for objective fights.
  - Replace in order: `slot 6 -> slot 5 -> slot 4`.
- Arena:
  - Because Arena is teamfight-dense (and starts at level 3 with accelerated spool), shift defensive/utility counters one item earlier than Conquest.
  - Replace in order: `slot 6 -> slot 5` and only cut deeper if you are still getting hard-countered.

## Fast decision rules

- If enemy sustain is deciding fights before 10 minutes, buy anti-heal immediately rather than waiting for full damage curve.
- If enemy frontline survives your full first rotation, accelerate anti-tank (Titan’s/Heartseeker timing).
- If crit carry has Rage + Deathbringer completed, delay greed and slot Spectral now.
- If your engage is repeatedly interrupted by the same hard-CC source, prioritize Magi’s/Beads path before more damage.
- If you cannot survive long enough to cast a second spell, convert one damage slot into anti-burst immediately.
