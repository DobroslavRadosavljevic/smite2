# Conquest Counter Swaps (Kukulkan)

## Swap order rule

Default replacement priority:
- slot 7 -> slot 6 -> slot 5

Keep these anchors active whenever possible:
- Book scaling core
- at least one %pen/shred item
- at least one survival lever (relic upgrade or defensive slot)

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy team healing | Divine Ruin (earlier) | Polynomicon or Soul Reaver |
| Double tank / high HP frontline | Soul Reaver + Obsidian Shard timing earlier | Greedy utility slot |
| Hard dive assassins/warriors | Spirit Robe, Breastplate of Valor, Genji's Guard | Soul Reaver or Rod of Tahuti (last slot) |
| Single key hard-CC pick tool | Magi's Cloak, Purification Beads upgrade | Polynomicon or flex damage slot |
| Burst one-shot comps | Time-lock Aegis, Sphere of Negation | Last greedy damage slot |
| Need stronger peel/control | Gem of Isolation | Pure burst slot (usually Polynomicon) |

## Relic adaptation quick map

- Hard CC chain: Beads first upgrade.
- Burst dive / one-shot: Aegis first upgrade.
- Low-CC lobbies with strong frontline setup: Blink as second relic for pick angles.

## Fast rules

- If sustain decides first two objective fights, force Divine immediately.
- If tanks survive full combo cycles, accelerate Obsidian + Reaver timing.
- If you die before second spell cycle, buy one defense item now and keep fighting from longer angles.
