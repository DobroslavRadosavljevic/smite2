# Conquest Build 01: Best-Supported Default (OB29 Window)

Confidence: 0.79 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

Stable Kukulkan mid build for ranked Conquest when you need reliable lane pressure, safe scaling, and clean objective DPS.
This default is built around current OB29-window sources plus consistent high-rank usage patterns.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy comp is mixed (not full dive, not full poke).
- You need dependable lane-to-late scaling instead of niche counter tech.
- Your team can play around mid-prio and objective fights.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Gem of Focus
2. Evolved Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Polynomicon
5. Divine Ruin
6. Obsidian Shard
7. Rod of Tahuti

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First back: stabilize mana economy and start Book stack tempo.
2. Mid game: finish Desolation + Poly before committing to deep jungle fights.
3. Late game: lock Obsidian + Tahuti timing before Fire Giant swing fights.

## Why this works

- Kukulkan passive converts item mana into bonus Intelligence, so Book-heavy paths scale extremely hard.
- Gem of Focus + Desolation gives strong uptime and better reposition windows between casts.
- Poly converts confirmed ability hits into meaningful single-target burst for mid-fight picks.
- Divine + Obsidian keeps damage relevant into healing comps and frontline protection stacking.

## Playstyle plan

## Early

1. Prioritize clean wave control with Whirlwind, then contest neutral pressure safely.
2. Use Zephyr mainly after enemy movement is committed, not on cooldown for random poke.
3. Keep Slipstream available when jungle vision is weak.

## Mid

1. Play from side angles so Zephyr and ultimate travel through choke points.
2. Fight after enemy mobility/relics are taxed; Kukulkan excels at second-step punish.
3. Convert one pick into objective damage immediately instead of long chase paths.

## Late

1. Stay one screen behind frontline at objective standoffs.
2. Save ultimate for confirmed displacement/slow setups or dive disengage.
3. Win by repeating safe spell cycles, not by front-lining for greed damage.

## Relics and upgrades

- Default pair: Purification Beads + Aegis of Acceleration.
- Upgrade Beads first into hard chain-CC drafts.
- Upgrade Aegis first into burst dive or double-assassin pressure.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Burning Slipstream aggressively before enemy engage tools are shown.
- Forcing ultimate as opener with no setup and no relic advantage.
- Delaying Obsidian too long into double-protection frontlines.
