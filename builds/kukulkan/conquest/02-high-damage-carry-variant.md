# Conquest Build 02: High-Damage Carry Variant

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium)

## Build identity

Greedy carry setup for games where you can play for kill pressure and snowball off mid-fight resets.
This variant trades some safety for higher burst ceiling and stronger tank shred in extended fights.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy backline is punishable and your team can create vision/control first.
- You are not under constant hard-dive threat every fight.
- You want maximum damage conversion from landed abilities.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Evolved Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Polynomicon
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Obsidian Shard
7. Soul Reaver

## Power spike map

- Spike 1: Archmage + Book online.
- Spike 2: Desolation + Poly burst windows.
- Spike 3: Tahuti + Obsidian + Reaver for late objective and frontline melt.

## Why this works

- Archmage proc + Poly follow-up raises one-rotation pick threat.
- Book + Tahuti creates very high Intelligence scaling that Kukulkan converts efficiently.
- Obsidian + Reaver prevents full damage drop-off into high-HP, high-protection targets.

## How to play this variant

1. Play fog-side angles, not front-to-back centerline casting.
2. Wait for enemy movement/relic commit, then burst priority targets.
3. Keep enough spacing to survive first contact and cast a second cycle.

## Risk profile

- Very high carry upside if your team controls entry points.
- Punishable if you lose relics early or get collapsed before casting sequence completes.

## Fast swaps

- Need anti-heal now: Divine Ruin over Soul Reaver.
- Need anti-dive now: Spirit Robe over Soul Reaver.
- Need more control over raw burst: Gem of Isolation over Polynomicon.
