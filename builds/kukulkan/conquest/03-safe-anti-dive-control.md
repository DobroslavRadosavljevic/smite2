# Conquest Build 03: Safe Anti-Dive Control Variant

Confidence: 0.77 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

Defensive control-focused Kukulkan setup for games where survival through first engage decides fights.
You keep core scaling while adding anti-dive durability and peel value.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy jungle + solo can reliably reach you.
- Teamfights are decided by hard engage into your position.
- You need safer second-cycle casting over maximum burst greed.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Evolved Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Gem of Isolation
5. Spirit Robe
6. Obsidian Shard
7. Time-lock Aegis

## Why this works

- Gem of Isolation improves kiting and punishes melee entries through repeat slows.
- Spirit Robe adds reliable anti-burst value against hard-CC engage chains.
- You still keep Book + pen timing to avoid becoming a low-threat control bot.

## Practical gameplan

1. Hold Slipstream as disengage unless enemy position is fully confirmed.
2. Cast Whirlwind in your own approach lane first, then step with frontline.
3. Use ultimate as anti-dive punish/disengage tool when divers overcommit.
4. After first engage fails, retake space and pressure objectives with safe poke cycles.

## Swap priorities in this variant

- Heavy magical dive: Genji's Guard over Spirit Robe.
- Heavy physical dive: Breastplate of Valor over Spirit Robe.
- More peel needed: Magi's Cloak over Gem of Isolation.
