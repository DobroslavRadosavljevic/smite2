# Arena Build 01: OB29-Adjusted Default (Kukulkan)

Confidence: 0.82 (Medium-High)

Source quality note: SmiteSource Kukulkan/mage references were tagged Open Beta 28 when checked on February 25, 2026. OB29 adjustments here come from official OB29 notes plus current Kukulkan/item wiki data.

## Build identity

This is the safest high-value Arena baseline for Kukulkan in the OB29 environment.
It keeps the strongest mana-to-Intelligence scaling shell while adding reliable anti-frontline timing.

## OB29 adjustment snapshot

- OB29 (published February 23, 2026) does not list direct Kukulkan nerfs/buffs.
- OB29 updates `Sands Of Time` and `Pendulum Of The Ages` to adaptive stats, which still fits Kukulkan's Intelligence path.
- Kukulkan passive still rewards mana-heavy itemization, so mana items stay core.

## When to lock this build

- Standard Arena lobby with one frontliner and one backline threat.
- You need repeatable fight damage, not only one-shot attempts.
- Your team can provide at least one setup CC for ultimate confirms.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Book of Thoth (tier component)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Obsidian Shard
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Totem of Death
7. Divine Ruin (move earlier when healing is deciding fights)

## Leveling priority

1. `3` Whirlwind
2. `1` Zephyr
3. `2` Slipstream
4. Ultimate whenever available

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Pendulum + Book is your first consistent spike.
2. Spear + Obsidian is your anti-carry and anti-frontline breakpoint.
3. Rod + Totem is your late-fight kill secure window.

## Arena execution plan

1. Open fights by pre-placing `3` on choke points, then `1` for slow confirm.
2. Use `2` primarily as reposition unless the dash finish is guaranteed and safe.
3. Hold ultimate for forced movement, hard CC, or tight corridor fights.
4. If your team has ticket lead, play max range and avoid risky dash entries.

## Win condition

- Win repeated front-to-back trades with high uptime AoE.
- Force relics with Whirlwind/Zephyr pressure, then land confirmed ultimates to close fights.
