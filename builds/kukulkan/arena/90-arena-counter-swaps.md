# Arena Counter Swaps (Kukulkan)

Source quality note: SmiteSource references used for baseline item shells were tagged Open Beta 28 when checked on February 25, 2026; swap priorities are aligned to OB29 patch context and current item/god wiki pages.

## Swap timing rule

In Arena, counter pivots should happen one full slot earlier than Conquest:
- move slot 6 counters to slot 5 first
- if that is not enough, move the same counter to slot 4

Use this trigger because Arena fights are continuous and failed adaptations snowball ticket loss quickly.

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first | Trigger to act |
|---|---|---|---|
| High team healing | Divine Ruin | Totem of Death or Polynomicon | Two fights in a row where enemy healing out-values your burst |
| Double frontline stacking protections | Obsidian Shard earlier, Soul Reaver | Spear of Desolation or utility slot | Your full combo fails to drop tanks below 50% |
| Double dive assassins | Spirit Robe or Magi's Cloak | Polynomicon or Totem of Death | You die before second ability cycle in back-to-back fights |
| Hard-CC chain engage | Magi's Cloak + Beads upgrade | Highest-risk damage slot | One key stun/root repeatedly guarantees your death |
| Burst mage/assassin delete comp | Sphere of Negation, then Spirit Robe | Greediest damage slot | You are forced to relic before casting damage abilities |
| Extreme poke and reset | Chronos' Pendant for cooldown uptime | Soul Reaver or Polynomicon | You lose on attrition and cannot contest neutral space |

## Relic adaptation map

- Default: `Purification Beads`
- Burst-heavy enemy: `Time-lock Aegis` as second relic
- CC-heavy enemy: early Beads upgrade before greed damage
- Mixed burst + CC: Beads + Aegis, then itemize defense once

## Arena-specific micro rules

1. If you cannot safely cast `3` on wave/choke, buy survivability immediately.
2. If your ult is repeatedly blocked by frontliners, prioritize pen earlier.
3. If your team has ticket lead, preserve death count over max damage greed.
