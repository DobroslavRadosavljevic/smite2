# Arena Build 03: Safe Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.76 (Medium-High)

Source quality note: SmiteSource Kukulkan/mage references were tagged Open Beta 28 when checked on February 25, 2026. The utility pivots are adjusted for OB29 using official notes and current item/god wiki data.

## Build identity

Use this when you are getting collapsed on and cannot consistently finish full burst rotations.
This path trades peak damage for reliable control, anti-dive stability, and more total casts per match.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy has two or more hard-engage gods.
- Enemy CC chains repeatedly stop your ult channel setup.
- Your team has enough damage already and needs safer zone control.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Book of Thoth (tier component)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Book of Thoth
3. Gem of Isolation
4. Spirit Robe
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Totem of Death

Hard-CC alternative:
- Replace Spirit Robe with Magi's Cloak when one instant CC is the loss condition.

## Why this works for Arena

- `3` plus Gem of Isolation improves path control around portals, buffs, and center lane entrances.
- Spirit Robe or Magi's Cloak gives a survivability buffer to actually cycle cooldowns.
- You still retain Book + Obsidian + Rod scaling, so late-game damage remains meaningful.

## Play pattern

1. Place Whirlwind between divers and your backline path, not only under enemy backline.
2. Keep `2` Slipstream for disengage unless guaranteed kill conversion is available.
3. Ult after enemy mobility commits, not as first contact.
4. Prioritize staying alive over trading one-for-one when your team is ahead on tickets.

## Swap trigger rules

- If enemy healing is high, slot Divine Ruin at 4 or 5 before Rod.
- If tank pressure becomes primary, slot Soul Reaver in place of Totem.
- If burst mages are deleting you, add Sphere of Negation as final defensive pivot.
