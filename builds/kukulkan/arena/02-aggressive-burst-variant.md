# Arena Build 02: Aggressive Burst Variant

Confidence: 0.69 (Medium)

Source quality note: SmiteSource Kukulkan/mage references were tagged Open Beta 28 when checked on February 25, 2026. This OB29 variant applies official OB29 system/item updates on top of those baseline paths.

## Build identity

This variant maximizes one-rotation kill threat and objective pressure in short Arena windows.
It is stronger than default when enemy backline is fragile and your team can force clean engages.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy has low dive pressure and limited hard CC reach.
- Enemy backline has at least two squishy gods with weak self-peel.
- Your frontline can create stable setup for long-range ult confirms.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Book of Thoth (tier component)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Rod of Tahuti
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Soul Reaver
7. Polynomicon

Tank-heavy adjustment:
- Move Obsidian Shard to slot 4 and delay Rod of Tahuti or Polynomicon.

## Burst sequence plan

1. Pre-zone with `3` so targets path predictably.
2. `1` Zephyr for slow confirm.
3. Ultimate during confirmed CC, dash lockout, or corridor movement.
4. Weave one basic attack after ability bursts when safe to trigger Polynomicon value.

## Risk controls

- If you die before second cast cycle in two straight fights, swap Polynomicon to Spirit Robe or Magi's Cloak.
- If anti-heal is mandatory, replace Polynomicon with Divine Ruin immediately.
- If enemy frontliners stack protections early, never delay Obsidian past slot 4.

## Win condition

- Convert first relic burn into immediate execution pressure on enemy carries.
- End fights quickly before sustained brawl comps can out-value you.
