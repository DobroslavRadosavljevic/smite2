# Core Mechanics, Skill Orders, and Combos

## What defines Kukulkan mechanics in SMITE 2

- **Passive scaling is mana-conversion scaling.** `Power of the Wind Jewel` converts **7% of Item Mana into Intelligence**, so mana-heavy mage paths directly increase damage, not just sustain.[1]
- **Base-kit 2/3 interaction is the main mechanical skill check.** In base form, `Slipstream` is a speed/slow-immunity tool, but if activated inside `Whirlwind`, it becomes a damaging dash with its own slow.[1]
- **Damage profile is layered, not one-button burst.**
  - `Whirlwind` provides repeat DoT pressure (6 ticks over 2.5s, 20% INT scaling per tick).[1]
  - `Zephyr` adds reliable ranged poke and a 3s slow for setup/confirm.[1]
  - `Spirit of the Nine Winds` is long-range finishing burst with displacement.[1]
- **Aspect of the Squall meaningfully changes combos and priority.** With the Aspect, `Slipstream` is always a dash with protection reduction, and `Whirlwind` follows Kukulkan then explodes with knockback, enabling more aggressive, front-loaded sequences.[1]

## Recommended skill orders

## Conquest default (base kit)

1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 3 (`Whirlwind`) first
3. Max 1 (`Zephyr`) second
4. Max 2 (`Slipstream`) last

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 3
- L2: 1
- L3: 2
- L4: 3
- L5: 4

Why:
- `Whirlwind` is Kukulkan's most consistent lane and choke pressure tool, and scales strongly through repeat ticks.[1]
- `Zephyr` is short-cooldown poke with escalating slow value, making it the best follow-up max.[1]
- `Slipstream` is mostly utility early in base kit; its dash damage is conditional on being inside `Whirlwind`, so it is usually lower priority than 3/1 for standard mid pacing.[1]

## Aspect of the Squall variant

1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 1 (`Zephyr`) first
3. Max 2 (`Slipstream`) second
4. Max 3 (`Whirlwind`) last

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 1
- L2: 2
- L3: 3
- L4: 1
- L5: 4

Why:
- Aspect `Zephyr` becomes a 3-projectile damage pattern and is your best early pick pressure button.[1]
- Aspect `Slipstream` is always-dash and applies protection reduction, so ranking it earlier improves all-in threat windows.[1]
- Aspect `Whirlwind` gives utility/space value, but usually contributes less raw early burst than 1/2 in this mode.[1]

## Core combos

## Standard poke-to-kill chain (base kit)

1. 3 (`Whirlwind`) at enemy pathing lane
2. Hold angle, then 1 (`Zephyr`) to slow as they try to exit
3. Reposition with 2 (`Slipstream`) or dash from inside 3 when commit is safe
4. 4 (`Spirit of the Nine Winds`) to secure when movement options are forced

## Safe confirm combo (base kit)

1. 1 to apply slow and force beads/dash options
2. 3 under slowed target path
3. Wait for movement commitment
4. 4 through retreat line for confirm

## Anti-dive peel combo

1. 3 on your own feet or choke edge
2. 2 for slow immunity and spacing
3. 1 on the diver while kiting back
4. Use relic defensively first, then re-cast for turn if they overcommit

## Aspect all-in combo

1. Blink (or flank angle)
2. 2 (`Slipstream`) through target for protection reduction
3. 3 (`Whirlwind`) for follow/explosion knockback pressure
4. 1 (`Zephyr`) immediately after displacement
5. 4 to finish once they are committed to a line

## Relic defaults and when to buy each

## Primary defensive default: Purification Beads

- `Purification Beads`: on use, CC immunity for 2s (150s cooldown).[2]
- Take first into hard-CC chains that prevent Kukulkan from repositioning or casting safely.
- Practical note: this is the safest universal queue default for mage mid when enemy engage is reliable.

## Anti-burst default: Aegis of Acceleration

- `Aegis of Acceleration`: immunity to damage/healing for 1.5s; gains movement speed when god damage is prevented; 140s cooldown.[3]
- Strong into dive/burst comps where survival of first contact decides fight outcome.
- Use to bait enemy commit, then counter with 1/4 during post-Aegis spacing.

## Proactive pick tool: Blink Rune

- `Blink Rune`: teleport up to 5.6m, disabled for 3s after dealing/taking god damage; damaging/killing a god within 4s reduces cooldown; 140s base cooldown.[4]
- Best when you are creating your own engage angles (especially with Aspect dash follow-up).
- Not default into heavy chain-CC unless your team already covers peel and cleanse pressure.

## Quick relic decision rules

- Into layered hard-CC: **Beads first**, then Aegis.
- Into heavy burst with lighter CC: **Aegis first**, then Beads.
- Into low-CC, high-pick tempo drafts: **Blink first**, then Beads or Aegis based on who threatens you most.

## Current live-build tendency (supporting evidence)

- SmiteBrain's Kukulkan build feed (Master+/OB29 data page) currently shows `Aspect of the Squall` usage and recurring relic appearances for **Purification Beads**, **Blink Rune**, and **Aegis of Acceleration**, which aligns with the above relic priority tree.[5]
