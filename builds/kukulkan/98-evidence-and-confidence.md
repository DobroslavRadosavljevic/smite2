# Evidence and Confidence (Kukulkan)

Date anchored: 2026-02-25

## Patch status

- Official live patch window: OB29 (published 2026-02-23).
- No direct Kukulkan kit/stat changes found in OB28 or OB29 official notes.
- Latest explicit Kukulkan gameplay change in official notes appears in OB27 (Aspect of the Squall nerf to Zephyr slow and Slipstream protection effects).

## Important data quality note

Public Kukulkan build feeds are mixed across patch tags:
- OB29-tagged examples are available, but OB28 and OB27-tagged Kukulkan builds are still prominent in public build indexes.
- Because of that, OB29 recommendations should be treated as best-supported convergence, not as an absolute solved build state.

## Confidence tiers used

- Tier A: official first-party notes/API and direct wiki mechanics
- Tier B: patch-tagged SmiteSource builds and metadata
- Tier C: supporting community sources (SMITEFire, Steam discussions, etc.)

## What can be asserted safely

- Conquest has a best-supported default build shell in the OB29 patch window.
- Arena recommendations are practical OB29 adaptations with medium confidence due mixed patch-tag freshness.
- Kukulkan itemization can safely prioritize high Intelligence scaling, cooldown pacing, and positioning/survivability adaptation by matchup.

## What should not be asserted

- A single mathematically absolute best Kukulkan build for every lobby and skill bracket.
