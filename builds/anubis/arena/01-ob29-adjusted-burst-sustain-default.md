# Arena Build 01: OB29-Adjusted Burst-Sustain Default

Confidence: 0.81 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the best-supported practical Arena baseline in the OB29 window.
It balances burst, sustain, and cooldown so Anubis can repeatedly contribute in grouped fights.

## When to lock this build

- Standard Arena lobby with mixed enemy comp.
- You want consistent damage every fight, not pure one-rotation gamble.
- Team comp can hold space for your channels.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Totem of Death
4. Soul Gem
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Blood-Bound Book
7. Obsidian Shard

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Finish Pendulum + Bancroft before forcing repeated center brawls.
2. Totem/Soul Gem marks your mid-game damage reliability point.
3. Bring Obsidian online as soon as enemy frontline starts stacking defense.

## Why this works

- Strong sustained spell output with reliable pen timing.
- Better fight-to-fight uptime than pure one-shot paths.
- Fits Arena's constant engagement structure.

## Playstyle plan

1. Use 2 to confirm value, not as blind poke.
2. Cast 3 to control movement before channeling 1 or 4.
3. Fight from side angles; avoid centerline channel traps.
4. Prioritize survival once team has ticket lead.

## Win condition

- Burn enemy relics with controlled setups, then secure picks with 2 -> 3 -> 1/4.
- Protect your death count when ahead on tickets; do not trade recklessly.
