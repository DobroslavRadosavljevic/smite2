# Arena Build 03: Control Anti-Dive Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.73 (Medium)

## Build identity

Use this when you are repeatedly targeted by divers and cannot finish channels with greedy builds.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy has two or more hard divers.
- Enemy CC chains are deleting your uptime.
- Your team already has enough damage but needs stable follow-up.

## Full item order

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Gem of Isolation
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Obsidian Shard
5. Totem of Death
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Spirit Robe

Relic preference:
- Beads first
- Aegis if burst is the bigger threat

## Why this works

- Gem of Isolation helps control melee approach paths.
- Spirit Robe increases survivability through burst/CC overlap.
- You keep enough pen + scaling to stay relevant.

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Get Gem of Isolation early to control approach vectors.
2. Add pen before late game so your damage does not fall off into tanks.
3. Finalize Spirit Robe timing based on enemy burst frequency.

## Playstyle plan

1. Drop 3 in front of your backline path, not just on enemies.
2. Save 2 for divers if they are your main loss condition.
3. Channel only when enemy control tools are committed.

## Win condition

- Outlast engage windows and punish overextension with repeated cooldown cycles.
