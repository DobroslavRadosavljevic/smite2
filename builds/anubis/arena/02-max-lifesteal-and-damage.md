# Arena Build 02: Maximum Lifesteal and Damage

Confidence: 0.66 (Medium-Low)

## Build identity

This is the requested max lifesteal + damage Arena variant.
It is greedier than default, with stronger sustain spikes in full-commit brawls.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy team has low anti-heal commitment in first few fights.
- You can play around teammate setup and avoid blind channels.
- You need solo carry potential from raw damage + sustain.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Vampiric Shroud
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion

## Core progression

1. Blood-soaked Shroud
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Typhon's Heart
4. Soul Gem
5. Blood-Bound Book
6. Totem of Death
7. Rod of Tahuti

Tank-heavy enemy adjustment:
- Swap Blood-Bound Book or Totem for Obsidian Shard earlier.

## Power spikes

- Spike 1: Blood-soaked Shroud + Bancroft's Talon.
- Spike 2: Typhon's Heart + Soul Gem.
- Spike 3: Rod of Tahuti with at least one pen/shred item online.

## Why this works

- Massive lifesteal stack plus high-int scaling for channel-heavy fights.
- Passive and ult interaction improve survivability during all-in windows.
- Strong punish potential when enemies fail to burst you instantly.

## How to play

1. Do not open with ult unless setup is guaranteed.
2. Force relics first, then commit full channel damage.
3. Respect anti-heal timings and back off if you lose sustain edge.

## Risk controls

- If enemy buys early anti-heal on multiple players, pivot one greed slot immediately.
- If enemy has double dive, add Spirit Robe or Magi's Cloak before final damage item.
