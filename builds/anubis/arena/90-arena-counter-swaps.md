# Arena Counter Swaps (Anubis)

## Swap order rule

In Arena, shift counters earlier than Conquest:
- slot 6 -> slot 5
- then slot 4 if enemy comp fully invalidates your sustain path

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing | Divine Ruin | Blood-Bound Book or Soul Gem |
| Double tank | Obsidian Shard earlier, Soul Reaver | Utility slot |
| Hard dive | Spirit Robe, Magi's Cloak | Greedy damage slot |
| Hard CC chains | Beads + Magi's + Time-lock Aegis path | Greedy damage slot |
| Burst delete comps | Aegis path + one defense item | Greedy damage slot |

## Arena-specific note

Anubis gains more from one extra survival slot in Arena than in Conquest because fights are more frequent and escape paths are shorter.

## Relic adaptation quick map

- CC-heavy enemy setup: Beads first upgrade.
- Burst-heavy enemy setup: Aegis first upgrade.
- If both are high and your team can peel, run Beads + Aegis before considering Blink.
