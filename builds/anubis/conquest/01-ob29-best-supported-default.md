# Conquest Build 01: Best-Supported Default (OB29 Window)

Confidence: 0.76 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

Balanced mid-lane damage profile with strong cooldown flow, penetration timing, and stable scaling.
This is the best-supported default from the latest patch-tagged Anubis build sources available in the OB29 window.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy comp has mixed frontline/backline, not full dive.
- Your team has at least one reliable setup tool (stun, pull, taunt, root).
- You want stable value from early lane through late objective fights.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Aegis of Acceleration or Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Soul Gem
5. Totem of Death
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Obsidian Shard

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First back: finish starter path and secure mana/cooldown comfort.
2. Mid game: complete Bancroft + Spear before forcing heavy 5v5s.
3. Late game: do not delay Obsidian once tanks have multiple defense items.

## Why this works

- Keeps high ability uptime for wrap-confirm windows.
- Preserves strong anti-frontline breakpoints with Obsidian + Totem + Tahuti scaling.
- Bancroft + Soul Gem provides practical sustain without overcommitting to full lifesteal greed.

## Playstyle plan

## Early

1. Farm safely with 3 and hold 2 for gank defense.
2. Do not hard-channel 1 without setup.
3. Track enemy jungler before stepping up for full combo trades.

## Mid

1. Shove and rotate with your support/jungle.
2. Fight from choke edges, not center lane.
3. Use ult as confirmed burst, not blind opener.

## Late

1. Save 2 for highest-threat diver unless free pick appears.
2. Force fights around terrain where 3 and 4 are hard to sidestep.
3. Prioritize surviving first engage and outputting full second cycle.

## Relics and upgrades

- Default: Beads + Aegis.
- Into low hard-CC comps: Blink can replace Aegis for proactive picks.
- Upgrade Beads first if enemy fight win condition is chain CC on you.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Starting ult with no setup and no relic advantage.
- Burning 2 for random poke before enemy diver commits.
- Standing centerline in jungle chokes while channeling.
