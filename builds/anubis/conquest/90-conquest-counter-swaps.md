# Conquest Counter Swaps (Anubis)

## Swap order rule

Default replacement priority:
- slot 6 -> slot 5 -> slot 4

Keep at least one penetration/shred slot active.
Keep at least one survival tool (relic or defensive item) if enemy dive is high.

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing | Divine Ruin | Blood-Bound Book or Soul Gem |
| Double tank | Obsidian Shard earlier, Soul Reaver | Gem of Isolation or utility slot |
| Hard dive | Spirit Robe, Magi's Cloak | Greedy damage slot |
| Hard CC chains | Purification Beads, Magi's Cloak, Time-lock Aegis | Greedy damage slot |
| Burst one-shot | Aegis path, defensive cloak slot | Greedy damage slot |

## Relic adaptation quick map

- Hard CC chain: Beads first upgrade.
- Burst mages/assassins: Aegis first upgrade.
- Low-CC lobbies where your team starts fights: Blink second relic for picks.
