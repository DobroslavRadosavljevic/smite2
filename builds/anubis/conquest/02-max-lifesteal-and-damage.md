# Conquest Build 02: Maximum Lifesteal and Damage

Confidence: 0.71 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the requested max lifesteal + damage Conquest variant.
It stacks lifesteal scaling and high intelligence to abuse Anubis channel DPS and sustain windows.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy comp lacks reliable anti-heal timing in early/mid game.
- Enemy engage is predictable and can be punished by counter-channeling.
- Your team can peel once your relics are down.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Vampiric Shroud
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Blood-soaked Shroud
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Typhon's Heart
4. Soul Gem
5. Blood-Bound Book
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Obsidian Shard

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Rush Blood-soaked Shroud + Bancroft for first sustain spike.
2. Add Typhon's Heart before long objective fights whenever possible.
3. Fit Obsidian by late game if tanks are stacking magical defense.

## Why this works

- Bancroft + Typhon + Soul Gem + passive scaling produce high sustain under pressure.
- Blood-Bound Book and Tahuti keep top-end magical damage high.
- Obsidian prevents full damage collapse into tank-heavy comps.

## How to play this build

1. Fight around confirmed setup only (2 into 3 and 1/4).
2. You are strongest in committed fights where channels can finish.
3. If enemy anti-heal spikes early, pivot one slot to anti-heal or defense.

## Power spikes

- Spike 1: Blood-soaked Shroud + Bancroft's Talon.
- Spike 2: Typhon's Heart + Soul Gem.
- Spike 3: Rod of Tahuti online with pen option completed.

## Risk profile

- High payoff, but punishable if enemy comp has layered CC + anti-heal focus.
- Requires good channel discipline and positioning.

## Fast swaps

- Need anti-heal: Divine Ruin over Blood-Bound Book
- Need anti-dive: Spirit Robe over Blood-Bound Book
- Need safer burst denial: Time-lock Aegis path
