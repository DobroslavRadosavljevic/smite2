# Conquest Build 03: Safe Anti-Dive Control Variant

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

For games where enemy dive or pick pressure is the main threat.
This variant gives more survivability and control reliability while preserving core damage.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy jungle + solo can consistently force your relics.
- Enemy support has reliable hard engage (blink setup, chain CC).
- Your team needs you alive for second damage cycle, not all-in one-shot.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Helm of Radiance
4. Totem of Death
5. Void Stone
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Time-lock Aegis

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Get your first defensive layer by third completed item at latest.
2. Bring shred (Void Stone/Totem) online before late objective fights.
3. Upgrade defensive relic early if enemy burst combo keeps deleting you.

## Why this works

- Extra protections and survivability improve channel completion rate.
- Still keeps high-intelligence scaling and shred tools.
- Better for compositions where you must survive first contact before carrying fights.

## Playstyle plan

1. Hold 2 for peel unless enemy carry mispositions hard.
2. Play with frontline and force enemies through 3 zones.
3. Use ult as anti-dive punish when divers commit.

## Win condition

- Survive first engage, then punish overcommit with controlled channels.
- Convert one picked diver into objective pressure, not greedy chase paths.
