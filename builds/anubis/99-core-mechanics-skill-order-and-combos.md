# Core Mechanics, Skill Orders, and Combos

## What defines Anubis itemization

- Anubis is channel-heavy and scales hard with Intelligence.
- Passive and ultimate interaction increases sustain pressure at low health and during ult channel.
- Successful Anubis play is mostly about setup, positioning, and anti-dive discipline.

## Recommended skill order

Default for both Conquest and Arena:
1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 1 (Plague of Locusts) first
3. Max 3 (Grasping Hands) second
4. Max 2 (Mummify) last

Early levels:
- L1: 1
- L2: 3
- L3: 2
- L4: 1
- L5: 4

Why:
- 1 gives the biggest sustained damage profile in realistic trades.
- 3 gives reliable wave and area control value.
- 2 is primarily setup utility and does not scale damage as hard as 1/3.

## Core combos

## Safe confirm combo

1. 2 (Mummify) to lock target
2. 3 (Grasping Hands) under target
3. 1 (Plague of Locusts) while they are controlled
4. Ult if needed for secure finish

## High-commit pick combo

1. Blink in
2. 2 to confirm
3. 3 immediately
4. 4 (Death Gaze)

## Anti-dive self-peel combo

1. Cast 3 at your feet
2. Hold 2 for diver entry
3. Step to edge of 3 and channel 1
4. Ult only if kill/turn is guaranteed

## Positioning rules

- Never channel from frontline center; use side angles and cover.
- If 2 misses, disengage and reset cooldown cycle.
- Reposition immediately when 1 or 4 channel ends.
- In Arena, prioritize survival and wave/ticket value over random chase.

## Relic defaults

- Purification Beads into hard-CC chains.
- Aegis of Acceleration into burst dive.
- Blink Rune for proactive pick setups.
