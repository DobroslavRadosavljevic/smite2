# Evidence and Confidence (Anubis)

Date anchored: 2026-02-25

## Patch status

- Official live patch window: OB29 (published 2026-02-23).
- No direct Anubis changes found in OB27/OB28/OB29 official notes.
- Latest explicit Anubis change found in OB26.

## Important data quality note

Public Anubis build feeds are lagging behind the official patch window:
- SmiteSource Anubis index currently surfaces OB28 as current-tagged for Anubis build cards.
- Because of that, OB29 recommendations are best-supported adaptations from OB28 plus official OB29 system context.

## Confidence tiers used

- Tier A: official first-party notes/API and direct wiki mechanics
- Tier B: patch-tagged SmiteSource builds and metadata
- Tier C: supporting community sources (SMITEFire, Steam discussions, etc.)

## What can be asserted safely

- Conquest has a best-supported default build shell in the OB29 patch window.
- Arena builds are practical adaptations with medium confidence because direct OB29 Arena-tagged Anubis data is sparse.
- Max lifesteal + damage builds are viable for Anubis due channel-heavy kit and passive/ult sustain interactions.

## What should not be asserted

- A single mathematically absolute best Anubis build for every lobby and skill bracket.
