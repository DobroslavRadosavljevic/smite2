# Core Mechanics, Skill Orders, and Combos

## Why Discordia play is OB29-contextual

- Official OB29 notes list no direct Discordia kit/stat changes, so her pre-OB29 tuning profile remains the baseline.
- OB29 does include a Conquest role pass (`Mid` gets +1.5 MPS), which slightly improves early spell cadence and mana comfort.
- Discordia's win condition is still control-first backline mage play: force bad movement with `Strife`/`Golden Apple of Discord`, then convert with repeated `Unruly Magic` cycles while staying uncatchable with `Erratic Behavior`.

## Recommended skill orders

## Conquest default

1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 1 first (`Unruly Magic`)
3. Max 2 second (`Strife`)
4. Max 3 last (`Erratic Behavior`)

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 1
- L2: 2
- L3: 3
- L4: 1
- L5: 4

Why:
- `Unruly Magic` is your most reliable wave + poke throughput.
- `Strife` second gives stronger midgame pick/peel control.
- `Erratic Behavior` is essential utility, but its value comes from timing and positioning more than early rank investment.

## Arena default

1. Level ultimate whenever possible
2. Max 2 first (`Strife`) in clustered, high-brawl lobbies
3. Max 1 second (`Unruly Magic`)
4. Max 3 last (`Erratic Behavior`)

Alternative Arena order for spread fights:
- Max 1 before 2 when enemies play wide and you need safer long-range poke uptime over immediate control value.

## Core combos

## Safe lane trade combo

1. Cast 2 (`Strife`) to force root (single target) or madness (multiple targets)
2. Place 1 (`Unruly Magic`) on the forced movement path
3. Backstep and hold 3 unless enemy commit is confirmed

## Pick-confirm combo

1. 2 (`Strife`) for root confirm
2. 1 (`Unruly Magic`) for primary burst window
3. 4 (`Golden Apple of Discord`) to prevent escape and secure collapse
4. 3 (`Erratic Behavior`) to reset angle after cast cycle

## Teamfight disruption combo

1. Start with 4 into grouped targets to apply cripple+tremble pressure
2. Layer 2 into the same zone for follow-up root/madness disruption
3. Fire 1 through the control zone while enemy pathing is broken
4. Re-anchor in/near 3 field and repeat when cooldowns return

## Anti-dive self-peel combo

1. 3 backwards to create a stealth + movement + cooldown buffer zone
2. 2 at your feet or at diver entry line
3. 1 point-blank as diver commits through control
4. Hold 4 for second engager or guaranteed turn kill

## Positioning rules

- Play second line and off-angle; Discordia loses value when she frontlines first.
- Treat 3 as your permission tool: if `Erratic Behavior` is down, shorten your angle immediately.
- Prefer fighting around walls/chokes where 1 and ult trajectory pressure is harder to read.
- In Conquest, only step into fog when your support/jungle can cover your escape path.
- In Arena, prioritize control on grouped enemies over deep solo chase.

## Relic defaults (OB29)

- `Purification Beads`: default first relic versus hard-CC chains.
- `Aegis of Acceleration`: default second into burst dive or heavy commit assassins.
- `Blink Rune`: replace Aegis in lower-threat games when your comp needs proactive pick angles.
- OB29 upgrade timing rule: `Time-lock Aegis` and `Blinking Abyss` were nerfed in OB29, so do not over-prioritize early relic upgrades over core damage spikes unless survivability is the immediate bottleneck.

## Common mistakes

- Spending 3 aggressively before enemy engage cooldowns are shown.
- Throwing 4 as poke with no nearby conversion window.
- Using 2 only for single-target root when high-value madness clumps are available.
- Failing to reposition after each 1/2 cycle.
- Forcing early relic upgrades in OB29 and delaying critical midgame damage thresholds.
