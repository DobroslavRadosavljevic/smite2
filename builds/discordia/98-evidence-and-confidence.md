# Evidence and Confidence (Discordia)

Date anchored: 2026-02-25

## Patch status

- Current official patch window: OB29 - The Dark Enchantress Update.
- Official OB29 publish timestamp (CMS): 2026-02-23T17:52:17.056Z.
- No explicit Discordia mention found on official SMITE2.com OB27/OB28/OB29 news pages.
- Official SMITE 2 Wiki patch pages include Discordia nerf entries in OB27 and OB28; no Discordia entry found in the OB29 wiki patch page.

## Important data quality note

Public Discordia build feeds are mixed across patch tags:
- SmiteSource Discordia index currently surfaces at least one OB29-tagged build plus multiple OB28-tagged builds.
- Because of that mix, OB29 recommendations should be treated as evidence-based convergence, not a mathematically complete global truth.

## Confidence tiers used

- Tier A: official SMITE 2 news pages and CMS payload/timestamp endpoints
- Tier B: official SMITE 2 Wiki god/patch pages and wiki revision metadata
- Tier C: SmiteSource build metadata and patch tags
- Tier D: supporting community references (SMITEFire, Smitebrain, Steam mirrors)

## What can be asserted safely

- OB29 is the active patch anchor in this research window.
- Discordia does not have a directly visible OB29 change callout in first-party SMITE2.com patch notes.
- Discordia does have explicit nerf callouts in the official wiki OB27 and OB28 patch pages.
- Discordia remains an intelligence burst/control mage whose kit supports combo-driven picks and teamfight disruption.

## What should not be asserted

- A single mathematically absolute best Discordia build for every lobby, role variant, and skill bracket.
- That every popular Discordia build card currently surfaced by public aggregators is fully OB29-current.
- That Discordia received an OB29 buff/nerf in official SMITE2.com notes (no first-party direct evidence found).
