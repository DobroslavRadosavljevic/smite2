# Arena Build 03: Safe Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.77 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

Use this when enemy dive and CC chains are reducing your uptime before you can cycle spells.
This path gives Discordia better control and survivability while keeping enough penetration to stay relevant.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy comp has two hard divers or repeated backline access.
- You are being forced into defensive relic usage every fight.
- Your team already has enough raw damage and needs stable follow-up control.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Aegis Amulet
5. Health Potion

## Core progression

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Gem of Isolation
3. Divine Ruin
4. Soul Gem
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Spirit Robe

Relic preference:
- Beads first upgrade versus hard-CC comps.
- Time-lock Aegis second versus burst-delete comps.

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Gem of Isolation early controls approach paths and peel angles.
2. Divine Ruin by item 3 if healers are winning extended Arena trades.
3. Obsidian before late game keeps damage online into double frontline.
4. Spirit Robe timing is mandatory once enemy dive reaches your backline consistently.

## Why this works

- Discordia's control tools scale well with added slow/zone pressure in Arena corridors.
- You keep anti-heal plus penetration so utility does not become zero-damage.
- One defensive slot dramatically improves survival in nonstop Arena engagements.

## Playstyle plan

1. Place Strife where divers must path through, not only on current target.
2. Save Erratic Behavior for the second half of fights to avoid predictable jump timings.
3. Use Golden Apple as a counter-engage tool into clustered melee dives.
4. If your team is ahead in tickets, play front-to-back and avoid unnecessary flank gambles.

## Win condition

- Survive the first enemy engage, then win the reset fight with control layering and repeated cooldown cycles.
