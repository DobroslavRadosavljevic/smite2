# Arena Build 02: Aggressive Burst Variant

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the high-risk, high-reward Discordia variant for deleting carries in one rotation.
You trade some consistency for stronger early-mid burst windows and faster pick tempo.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy team has two or more fragile backliners.
- Your frontline can start fights and burn enemy relics first.
- You are comfortable tracking Beads/Aegis timers and playing off cooldown windows.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Blink Rune
4. Purification Beads
5. Health Potion

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Rod of Tahuti
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Soul Reaver
7. Divine Ruin

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Archmage + Book is your first true one-rotation spike.
2. Spear by slot 3 stabilizes cooldown tempo for repeat picks.
3. Move Obsidian earlier if two enemies are rushing magical defense.
4. Divine Ruin is mandatory by late game if enemy sustain remains relevant.

## Why this works

- Archmage proc plus Discordia's 2 -> 1 -> 4 chain creates lethal burst on isolated carries.
- Book of Thoth and Rod of Tahuti maximize intelligence scaling for punish windows.
- Spear of Desolation resets let you stay threatening in Arena's frequent skirmishes.

## Playstyle plan

1. Only Blink aggressively when enemy defensive relics are burned or forced.
2. Burst in one committed cycle, then use Erratic Behavior to disengage and reset.
3. Prioritize enemy damage dealers over tanks unless a tank is already execution range.
4. Do not tunnel for montage kills when your team is already ahead on tickets.

## Risk controls

- If enemy divers are repeatedly reaching you, swap Divine Ruin for Spirit Robe.
- If anti-heal is already covered by teammates, use Gem of Isolation as the final slot instead.

## Win condition

- Convert every relicless carry into a quick pick, then immediately reset positions before the enemy counter-engage.
