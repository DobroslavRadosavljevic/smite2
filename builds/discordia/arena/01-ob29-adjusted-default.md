# Arena Build 01: OB29-Adjusted Default

Confidence: 0.82 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the safest OB29 baseline for Discordia in Arena.
It leans on adaptive starter scaling from OB29 and keeps a stable mix of cooldown, penetration, and late-game tank burn.

## When to lock this build

- Standard Arena lobby with mixed frontline/backline threat.
- You expect repeated grouped fights around pillars and center choke.
- Your team needs reliable control damage, not all-in glass-cannon only.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands Of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum Of The Ages
2. Spear of Desolation
3. Soul Gem
4. Obsidian Shard
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Soul Reaver
7. Gem of Isolation

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Pendulum + Spear is your first true Arena spike; do not over-force before this.
2. Soul Gem gives steadier mid-fight sustain and better repeat casts.
3. Obsidian by slot 4 keeps your damage relevant once tanks stack protections.
4. Soul Reaver closes games by adding reliable frontliner burn.

## Why this works

- Discordia's Strife into Unruly Magic pattern benefits from high cast frequency and penetration timing.
- Spear of Desolation cooldown refunds fit Arena kill/assist cadence.
- OB29 starter updates keep Sands/Pendulum a consistent intelligence path for mage tempo.

## Playstyle plan

1. Open with Strife to force bad movement, then confirm with Unruly Magic.
2. Use Erratic Behavior as a reposition tool after first cast cycle, not only as panic escape.
3. Hold Golden Apple for relicless targets or clustered fights, not random max-range tosses.
4. Fight on side angles; centerline standing gets punished too hard in Arena.

## Win condition

- Win repeated cooldown cycles without dying first: force relics with 2 -> 1 pressure, then close fights with ult while your team pushes ticket advantage.
