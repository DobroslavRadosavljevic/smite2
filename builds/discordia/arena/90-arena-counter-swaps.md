# Arena Counter Swaps (Discordia)

## Swap order rule

In Arena, move counters earlier than Conquest because fights are constant and reset windows are short.

- Default replacement order: slot 7 -> slot 6 -> slot 5
- If you are dying before second cast cycle, skip greed and insert defense immediately.

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing core | Divine Ruin by slot 2-3 | Gem of Isolation or Soul Gem |
| Double tank frontline | Obsidian Shard earlier + Soul Reaver lock | Utility slot |
| Hard dive assassins | Spirit Robe or Magi's Cloak | Greediest damage slot |
| Hard CC chain comp | Beads + Time-lock Aegis + Magi's Cloak | Blink or greediest slot |
| Burst delete comp | Aegis path + one defense item | Soul Reaver or late luxury item |

## Arena-specific micro rules

1. If you die before casting 2 full cycles in two fights, buy defense now.
2. If enemy healing wins extended trades, anti-heal no later than item 3.
3. If your team is up 40+ tickets, prioritize safe control and disengage over flank risk.
4. Do not hold ult forever in Arena; use it to force relics before next minotaur timer.

## Relic adaptation quick map

- CC-heavy enemy setup: Purification Beads first upgrade.
- Burst-heavy enemy setup: Aegis first upgrade.
- Mixed dive + burst setup: Beads + Aegis before Blink greed.

## OB29 context note

OB29 (published February 23, 2026) shifted starter behavior to adaptive logic and kept Sands/Pendulum as a stable intelligence baseline for mage spell-cycle play.
Counter-swapping should preserve that baseline unless a specific enemy threat is deleting your uptime.
