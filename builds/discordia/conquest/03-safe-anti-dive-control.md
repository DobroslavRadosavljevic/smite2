# Conquest Build 03: Safe Anti-Dive Control

Confidence: 0.79 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This variant is for high-pressure dive lobbies where surviving first contact matters more than max sheet damage.
It keeps Discordia's cooldown/pen core but adds defensive layers so you can still output a full second spell cycle.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy jungle + solo both have direct backline access.
- Enemy support has repeatable hard engage that forces relics early.
- Your team needs your CC and follow-up damage alive through the first 5 seconds of fights.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum of The Ages
2. Chronos' Pendant
3. Book of Thoth
4. Magi's Cloak
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Spirit Robe

## Lock checkpoints

1. First checkpoint (6:00-9:00): if enemy dive already burned your relics once, keep this path.
2. Second checkpoint (12:00-16:00): Magi's Cloak should be completed before repeated objective contests.
3. Third checkpoint (20:00+): if dives still connect, finish Spirit Robe before greed upgrades.

## Why this works

- Pendulum + Chronos keeps cooldown flow high even with defensive slots.
- Magi's Cloak blocks one key engage layer and often buys full combo time.
- Spirit Robe gives extra forgiveness against chained CC + burst commits.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game

1. Play one step deeper than normal and keep 3 available as disengage.
2. Trade only when your jungle can counter-gank.

## Mid game

1. Fight around your support, not isolated side pockets.
2. Use ult as anti-dive punish tool after enemies commit forward.

## Late game

1. Let enemy divers spend cooldowns first, then counter-cast full kit.
2. Prioritize staying alive for second rotation over chasing low HP targets.

## Safety upgrades and swaps

- If burst is still overwhelming: Time-lock Aegis as second relic.
- If enemy healing becomes the main issue: Divine Ruin over Chronos' Pendant.
- If game stabilizes and you are safe: Totem of Death over Spirit Robe for more closeout damage.
