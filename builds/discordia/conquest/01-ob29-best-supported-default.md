# Conquest Build 01: OB29 Best-Supported Default

Confidence: 0.86 (High)

## Build identity

This is the most stable Discordia Mid default in the current Open Beta 29 window.
It mirrors the live `mid-build` ordering on SmiteSource (updated February 25, 2026) and aligns with high-SR ranked patterns on smite2.live (Middle role samples in the 4400+ SR pool).

## When to lock this build

- You are Mid and enemy comp is balanced (not pure dive, not full tank brick wall).
- Your team has at least one reliable setup tool for Apple of Discord follow-up.
- You want a low-variance build that still scales hard into Fire Giant fights.

## Lock timing

1. Soft-lock at god select if enemy jungle + solo are not double hard-dive.
2. Hard-lock after first back if enemy support is not forcing early relic burns every wave.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Multi Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Spear of Desolation
3. Book of Thoth
4. Gem of Focus
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Totem of Death

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First back (around 3:30-5:00): finish early power pieces and keep mana sustain for repeat wave control.
2. First major spike (around 10:00-14:00): Spear of Desolation + Book of Thoth online before forcing frequent 5v5s.
3. Anti-frontline timing (around 17:00-22:00): Obsidian Shard completed before Gold Fury/Fire Giant pull windows.
4. Late closeout (22:00+): Rod of Tahuti then Totem of Death to maximize objective-fight DPS.

## Why this works

- CDR and penetration come online early enough to keep Discordia relevant in every rotation.
- Book + Rod scaling gives real late-game carry value instead of only early poke.
- Totem + Obsidian keeps damage from falling off into double-frontline teams.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game

1. Use Strife (1) and Unruly Magic (2) to clear first, poke second.
2. Save Erratic Behavior (3) as your anti-gank reset unless jungle vision is fully controlled.
3. Force relics with safe pressure; do not all-in without jungle proximity.

## Mid game

1. Push wave, then rotate with support toward side neutral fights.
2. Hold Apple of Discord (ult) for confirmed setups or punished overextensions.
3. Fight from side angles, not center choke, so 3 remains a real escape route.

## Late game

1. Play one screen behind frontline and value second spell cycle over risky first-cycle greed.
2. Prioritize enemy backline only when their dive tools are already committed.
3. Keep Beads for first hard-CC layer, then re-enter with full combo.

## Fast swaps (only if needed)

- Heavy healing: Divine Ruin over Gem of Focus or Totem of Death.
- Hyper dive: Magi's Cloak over Totem of Death.
- Extreme tank stack: move Obsidian Shard earlier and add Soul Reaver over Gem of Focus.
