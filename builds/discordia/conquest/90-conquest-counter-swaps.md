# Conquest Counter Swaps (Discordia)

## Swap order rule

Default replacement priority:
- slot 7 -> slot 6 -> slot 4

Never remove both major penetration slots at the same time.
Keep at least one anti-dive layer (item or relic) when enemy backline access is high.

## Counter matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing (Aphrodite, Hercules sustain, lifesteal cores) | Divine Ruin | Gem of Focus or Chronos' Pendant |
| Double frontline stacking protections | Soul Reaver and earlier Obsidian timing | Totem of Death or Gem of Focus |
| Assassin + warrior hard dive | Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe | Totem of Death, then Soul Reaver |
| Chain hard-CC engage | Time-lock Aegis and upgraded Beads | Greedy damage flex slot |
| Long fights where tanks survive first cycle | Soul Reaver + Totem of Death together | One defensive flex if safe |
| You are permanently one-shot before casting | Spirit Robe + Magi's Cloak together | Chronos' Pendant or Totem of Death |
| Enemy backline outranges and kites | Chronos' Pendant + Gem of Focus movement uptime | Slow, no-utility flex slot |

## Relic adaptation quick map

- Default: Purification Beads first.
- Burst + dive: Beads + Time-lock Aegis.
- Low-CC drafts where your team has hard engage first: Beads + Blinking Abyss for proactive ult angles.

## Build-specific swap notes

- Build 01 default: first offensive swap is Gem of Focus -> Divine Ruin or Soul Reaver.
- Build 02 high damage: first safety swap is Soul Reaver -> Magi's Cloak.
- Build 03 anti-dive: first greed swap (only when stable) is Spirit Robe -> Totem of Death.
