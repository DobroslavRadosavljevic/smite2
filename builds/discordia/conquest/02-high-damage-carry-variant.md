# Conquest Build 02: High Damage Carry Variant

Confidence: 0.81 (High)

## Build identity

This is the greedy high-damage carry variant for Discordia Mid.
It follows the live `1-shot-disco` high-output core (Chronos + Book + Soul Reaver finish), built to maximize late objective and frontline shred damage.

## When to lock this build

- You expect longer teamfights and need to be the primary magical carry.
- Enemy comp has at least one durable frontline target you must break repeatedly.
- Your support/jungle can peel enough for you to free-cast.

## Avoid locking this build when

- Enemy jungle + solo can force your relics every engage.
- Your team has weak peel and you are the first target every fight.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Conduit Gem
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Multi Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Archmage's Gem
2. Chronos' Pendant
3. Book of Thoth
4. Spear of Desolation
5. Obsidian Shard
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Soul Reaver

## Lock and checkpoint rules

1. Lock by level 5 if lane is stable and you can farm toward Chronos quickly.
2. At 2 completed items: contest only high-value fights where you can cast full cycle safely.
3. At 4 completed items: you can hard-carry grouped fights if relics are available.
4. At Soul Reaver completion: prioritize Fire Giant setups and frontline melt in every late fight.

## Damage pattern

1. Poke with 1/2 until enemy frontline steps into your range.
2. Use ult for guaranteed setup or to punish grouped targets.
3. Re-enter after first cooldown reset; this build wins extended spell-trade windows.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game

1. Minimize deaths and accelerate farm tempo; this build is item-threshold dependent.
2. Use 3 defensively in most rotations unless enemy relics are already down.

## Mid game

1. Rotate only when wave is secured and you can arrive first to choke points.
2. Cast from max safe range and force enemies to walk into your cooldown cycle.

## Late game

1. Hit closest high-value target first; Reaver + pen still threatens backline after front breaks.
2. Keep Beads for first hard-CC layer and do not trade it for low-value poke.

## Fast safety pivots

- Hard dive problem: Magi's Cloak over Soul Reaver.
- Heavy anti-heal requirement: Divine Ruin over Chronos' Pendant.
- Chain-CC lobby: Time-lock Aegis second relic and upgrade Beads earlier.
