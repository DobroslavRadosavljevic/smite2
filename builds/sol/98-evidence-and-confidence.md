# Evidence and Confidence (Sol)

Date anchored: 2026-02-25

## Patch status

- Official live patch window: OB29 (published 2026-02-23).
- Official OB29 CMS payload timestamp: 2026-02-23T17:52:17.056Z.
- No direct Sol kit/stat string hits were found in OB29 official note payload text.

## Important data quality note

Public Sol build feeds are mixed and partially lagging behind the official patch window:
- SmiteSource Sol index currently shows mostly OB28/OB27 tags.
- Several Sol build detail pages already include OB29 tags.
- Because of that, OB29 recommendations should be treated as best-supported adaptations, not hard absolutes.

## Confidence tiers used

- Tier A: official first-party notes/API and direct wiki mechanics
- Tier B: patch-tagged SmiteSource builds and metadata
- Tier C: supporting community sources (SMITEFire, Smitebrain, Steam, etc.)

## What can be asserted safely

- Sol remains a high-pressure magical carry/mid profile where sustained damage windows and positioning discipline are central.
- Conquest has a best-supported default build shell for the OB29 window.
- Arena recommendations are practical OB29-adjusted lines with medium confidence due mixed public patch-tag signals.

## What should not be asserted

- A single mathematically absolute best Sol build for every lobby, rank, or mode.
