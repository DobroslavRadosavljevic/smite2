# Core Mechanics, Skill Orders, and Combos

## What defines Sol in SMITE 2

- Sol is a hybrid-scaling mage whose basics are a major part of her real DPS profile.
- Her basic attack scales with Strength, Intelligence, and Basic Attack Power, so she can leverage both mage-style and carry-style stat lines.
- Unstable Manifestation (Passive) is the core engine: Heat amplifies item-derived Strength, Intelligence, and Attack Speed, and max Heat adds extra Basic Attack Damage.
- Heat math snapshot: each Heat gives +0.15% Strength, +0.25% Intelligence, and +0.3% Attack Speed from items; at max Heat, basics gain +15% damage.
- Heat decay starts after 6 seconds without generation, then drops at 3 Heat per 0.33 seconds.
- Heat uptime is mandatory. If your Heat drops before the fight starts, your damage floor drops with it.

## High-impact mechanics to play around

- Radiance (1): repeat AoE damage plus missing-health healing; hits 3 times over 3s, heals 6 ticks over 5s, and generates 30-70 Heat.
- Stellar Burst (2): next basic explodes and retracts, and both passes can apply damage/slow; generates 10 Heat and is your best short-trade trigger.
- Disapparate (3): speed/slow-immunity setup into full untargetable immunity window; generates 10 Heat and is your real anti-dive button.
- Supernova (4): 8 moving impact zones; first hit knocks back, later hits are reduced damage (30% subsequent hit value), and it generates 40 Heat.

## Recommended skill orders

## Conquest mid default (control + sustained DPS)

1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 1 first (Radiance)
3. Max 2 second (Stellar Burst)
4. Max 3 last (Disapparate)

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 1
- L2: 2
- L3: 3
- L4: 1
- L5: 4

Why:
- 1 gives reliable wave control, sustain, and Heat generation.
- 2 gives consistent trade value and setup for 1/4.
- 3 is mostly utility and safety, so one early point is enough.

## Duo lane magical ADC default (basic-attack carry Sol)

1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 2 first (Stellar Burst)
3. Max 1 second (Radiance)
4. Max 3 last (Disapparate)

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 2
- L2: 1
- L3: 3
- L4: 2
- L5: 4

Why:
- 2 gives earlier boxing pressure through slow plus double-hit threat.
- 1 remains critical for wave sustain and staying healthy in extended duo trades.
- 3 remains a survival point until teamfights get heavier.

## Core combos

## Safe lane poke

1. Preload Heat on wave with basic attacks.
2. Cast 2 and fire empowered basic at enemy.
3. Step to pressure the return hit window.
4. Place 1 under slowed target.
5. Continue basic attacks while holding 3 defensively.

## All-in kill confirm

1. Land 2 for slow setup.
2. Instantly place 1 to force awkward movement.
3. Weave basics while target is controlled/slowed.
4. Cast 4 across their escape path.
5. Use 3 either to chase through peel or immune return burst.

## Anti-dive self-peel

1. Drop 1 at your feet.
2. Fire 2 into diver entry angle.
3. Use 3 for slow immunity into full immune state.
4. Cancel 3 early only if re-entry is safe.
5. Turn with basics and 4 only after enemy CC commit is gone.

## Objective burn sequence (Gold Fury/Fire Giant/towers)

1. Start objective with Heat already high.
2. Weave 2-enhanced basics into normal auto cycle.
3. Keep 1 for sustain zone and anti-contest space.
4. Save 3 for enemy collapse or objective secure reposition.

## Magical ADC considerations (important)

- Base Sol passive strongly supports magical ADC play because Heat amplifies Attack Speed and adds Basic Attack Damage at max Heat.
- Aspect of Conflagration shifts Sol away from ADC: Heat no longer provides Strength, Attack Speed, or Basic Attack Damage. It instead pushes Intelligence/ability damage and adds a Disapparate immune-state eruption.
- Nimble Ring is a direct synergy item for magical ADC Sol because it grants Intelligence/Attack Speed/Lifesteal and converts Intelligence into Attack Damage plus additional Attack Speed.
- Bracer of The Abyss is strong for extended DPS windows and objective fights because it stacks Attack Damage on god/jungle-boss hits; Sol's multi-hit patterns help stack and maintain it.
- Gilded Arrow into Sharpshooter's Arrow is a viable duo economy/tempo path if you want stronger lane pressure and basic-attack scaling.
- Practical rule: if you want true magical ADC Sol, avoid Conflagration and play for Heat uptime + sustained basic windows. If you choose Conflagration, play her as ability-skewed burst/control.

## Common mistakes

- Starting fights below meaningful Heat and losing passive/item amplification.
- Spending 3 aggressively with no answer to incoming hard CC.
- Casting 4 at current position rather than projected movement path.
- Mixing Conflagration with pure basic-attack expectations.
- Ignoring wave state while forcing 2 trades and then losing lane sustain.
