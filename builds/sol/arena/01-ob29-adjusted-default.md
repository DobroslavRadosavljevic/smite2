# Arena Build 01: OB29-Adjusted Default (Sol)

Confidence: 0.76 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the best-supported practical Arena default for Sol in the OB29 patch window.
It combines the strongest overlapping Sol mage-core from current public builds, then adjusts for Arena's constant 5v5 cadence.

## When to lock this build

- Mixed enemy comp (one frontline + one diver or double frontline).
- You need stable damage over repeated fights, not one all-in.
- Your team can give you at least one peel cooldown per engage.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Aegis of Acceleration
4. Health Potion

## Core progression

1. Pendulum of the Ages
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Book of Thoth
4. Typhon's Heart
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Obsidian Shard

## Relic plan

- Upgrade Aegis of Acceleration into Time-lock Aegis once burst deaths become likely.
- Add Purification Beads as second relic when enemy CC chains are reliable.

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Pendulum + Bancroft is your first real Arena brawl spike.
2. Book + Typhon stabilizes sustain for back-to-back fights.
3. Rod + Obsidian is your anti-frontline + anti-carry late conversion point.

## Why this works

- Book + Rod gives scalable burst value through mid/late ticket phases.
- Bancroft + Typhon improves re-entry durability in short-reset Arena fights.
- Obsidian timing prevents tanks from fully blanking your damage.

## Playstyle plan

1. Poke from side angles first; do not open from centerline.
2. Use Disapparate mainly to reposition and avoid hard-engage collapse.
3. Commit Supernova after relic pressure, not as first contact.
4. If your team leads tickets, prioritize uptime over risky chase.

## Win condition

- Keep high spell uptime while surviving long enough for a second cycle.
- Convert one forced relic or pick into sustained ticket pressure, not isolated damage.
