# Arena Build 03: Safe Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.69 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the lower-risk Arena setup when enemy dive or CC pressure is high.
It keeps Sol's scaling core but prioritizes mobility uptime and defensive relic value.

## When to use this

- Enemy draft has repeat divers and hard engage.
- Your team needs your damage over time more than hard all-in burst.
- You are playing for consistent ticket control, not highlight dives.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion

## Core progression

1. Pendulum of the Ages
2. Gem of Focus
3. Book of Thoth
4. Spear of Desolation
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Obsidian Shard

## Relic and utility package

- Upgrade into Time-lock Aegis as soon as enemy burst windows become reliable.
- Keep Purification Beads online for hard-CC insurance.
- If you still get chain-locked, convert one damage slot into Magi's Cloak or Spirit Robe.

## Why this works

- Gem of Focus gives safer movement and spacing control in constant Arena scrims.
- Time-lock Aegis + Beads pairing increases survival through first enemy engage wave.
- Core pen + scaling (Spear/Book/Rod/Obsidian) keeps damage relevant without pure greed.

## Playstyle plan

1. Play around wave edges and side walls to reduce direct dive paths.
2. Hold Disapparate for disengage unless kill is guaranteed.
3. Trade cooldowns only when relics are ready; avoid dry-fighting.
4. In late ticket game, prefer controlled poke and cleanup over deep chase.

## Win condition

- Stay alive through first engage, then return damage during enemy cooldown downtime.
- Win long Arena rounds through uptime, positioning discipline, and repeatable pressure.
