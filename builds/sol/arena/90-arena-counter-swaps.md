# Arena Counter Swaps (Sol)

## Swap order rule

In Arena, move counters earlier than Conquest:
- slot 6 -> slot 5
- then slot 4 if enemy comp is already hard-countering your current shell

If you die before your second spell cycle in two straight fights, defensive/utility swap is mandatory.

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing (2+ strong heal sources) | Divine Ruin by item 3-4 | Typhon's Heart (default build) or Jade Scepter (burst build) |
| Double frontline or early MR stack | Obsidian Shard no later than slot 4 | Greedy scaling slot (usually Typhon/Jade) |
| Hard dive assassins (Loki / Hun Batz / Achilles style pressure) | Time-lock Aegis earlier, Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe | Most fragile damage slot |
| Hard CC chain | Purification -> Talisman of Purification, plus Magi's Cloak | Greedy damage slot |
| You cannot reach backline angles | Blinking Abyss for re-entry and flank access | Secondary defensive relic only if peel is reliable |
| Fights are poke/space wars and enemy keeps disengaging | Gem of Isolation for stickiness and zone control | Lowest-impact burst slot in current build |

## Arena micro-rules

1. Anti-heal is not optional if enemy sustain is deciding fights.
2. Survivability purchases are correct if they preserve second spell cycle uptime.
3. Do not delay relic upgrades once enemy burst windows are online.
