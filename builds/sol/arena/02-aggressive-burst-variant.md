# Arena Build 02: Aggressive Burst Variant

Confidence: 0.71 (Medium)

## Build identity

This variant frontloads burst and anti-heal pressure for high-tempo Arena lobbies.
You give up some sustain safety to force faster relic breaks and kill confirms.

## When to use this

- Enemy backline is punishable and your team can start fights for you.
- You need earlier anti-heal and flat-pen pressure.
- You are not being full-focused by double dive every fight.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion

## Core progression

1. Pendulum of the Ages
2. Spear of Desolation
3. Jade Scepter
4. Book of Thoth
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Obsidian Shard
7. Divine Ruin

## Relic aggression option

- If you are not dying first, add Blinking Abyss as second relic for angle-based kill confirms.
- If burst threat is high, keep defensive path and upgrade into Time-lock Aegis instead.

## Why this works

- Spear + Jade gives faster mid-fight burst windows.
- Divine Ruin stops heal-heavy comps from resetting fights.
- Book + Rod + Obsidian preserves late-game kill threat even in this aggressive shell.

## Playstyle plan

1. Use side-entry timing after your frontline starts contact.
2. Force enemy relics with first rotation; second rotation is your kill window.
3. Avoid standing still for long channels unless enemy dive cooldowns are spent.
4. If your team falls behind tickets, prioritize fast picks over extended poke.

## Risk profile

- Higher damage tempo, lower forgiveness.
- If you die before second spell cycle twice in a row, pivot to safer utility/defensive swaps immediately.
