# Conquest Counter Swaps (Sol)

## Swap order rule

Default replacement priority:
- Slot 7 -> Slot 6 -> Slot 5

Keep at least one penetration slot active at all times.
If enemy backline access is high, keep at least one survival layer (Magi's/Spirit Robe/Aegis upgrade).

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing (Aphrodite, sustained frontline) | Divine Ruin | Soul Gem (mid) or Bracer of the Abyss (ADC) |
| Double-tank front line | Soul Reaver and earlier Obsidian Shard timing | Hastened Fatalis (ADC) or greed damage slot (mid) |
| Hard dive + chain CC | Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe, Time-lock Aegis upgrade | Hastened Fatalis / Soul Gem first |
| Fed crit hunter | Spectral Armor + Aegis-first relic upgrade | Hastened Fatalis or Bracer of the Abyss |
| Low-CC game where you can free-cast | Bancroft's Talon or Dreamer's Idol greed slot | Magi's Cloak / defensive slot |

## Relic adaptation quick map

- Chain CC first: Beads upgrade first.
- Burst assassins first: Aegis upgrade first.
- Low lockdown and your team has engage: Blink second relic is viable.

## Role-specific note

- Mid Sol: prioritize pen and survival timing before luxury damage.
- ADC Sol: protect farm curve first; only pivot off DPS slots when deaths are preventing uptime.
