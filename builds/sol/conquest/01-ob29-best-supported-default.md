# Conquest Build 01: OB29 Best-Supported Default (Mid Sol)

Confidence: 0.80 (High)

## Build identity

Balanced mid-lane Sol for the OB29 window: stable lane clear, reliable cooldown flow, and late-game frontline burn.
This build is the convergence route from the latest public Sol build sets (OB28-tagged on SmiteSource) plus OB29 system updates (adaptive starters and Conquest role passives).

## When to lock this build

- Enemy comp is mixed (not full hard-dive, not full sustain cheese).
- Your team has at least one engage/setup tool for safe `Supernova` confirms.
- You want a default that scales cleanly into 25+ minute objective fights.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum of the Ages
2. Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Bancroft's Talon
5. Soul Gem
6. Rod of Tahuti
7. Obsidian Shard

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First back: stabilize mana and clear speed so you can safely contest wave priority.
2. Mid game spike: Book + Spear online before forcing risky jungle fights.
3. Late game tank breakpoint: do not delay Obsidian once solo/support stack protections.

## Why this works

- OB29 keeps Sands/Pendulum adaptive for intelligence casters, so Sol still gets high value from the starter path.
- Book + Rod + Obsidian gives dependable scaling and anti-frontline conversion.
- Spear + Soul Gem improves cycle damage and tempo in repeated mid-fight casts.
- Bancroft gives practical sustain for extended poke-and-reset fights around Gold Fury/Fire Giant.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game (levels 1-8)

1. Prioritize safe wave control with `Stellar Burst` and ranged basics.
2. Keep `Disapparate` as a defensive cooldown unless enemy jungle is visible elsewhere.
3. Trade only after forcing enemy key cooldowns; avoid long neutral trades with no ward line.

## Mid game (levels 9-16)

1. Shove lane, then rotate with support/jungle for side pressure and neutral camp control.
2. Use `Supernova` as a follow-up punish tool, not blind opener into available relics.
3. Fight from edges of choke points so divers must path through your frontline first.

## Late game (17+)

1. Play front-to-back and burn the closest safe target first.
2. Hold `Disapparate` for committed engage, not poke reposition.
3. If enemy carries overstep after first cooldown cycle, convert to pick then objective immediately.

## Relics and upgrades

- Default: Beads + Aegis.
- Into chain-CC comps: prioritize Beads upgrade first.
- Into burst dive: prioritize Aegis upgrade first.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Burning escape to poke when enemy assassin position is unknown.
- Opening every fight with `Supernova` before relics are checked.
- Delaying penetration too long versus two-tank frontlines.
