# Conquest Build 03: Safe Anti-Dive Control (Mid Sol)

Confidence: 0.77 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This variant is for games where enemy assassins and hard engage are the primary threat.
You trade some greed damage for anti-pick stability while keeping enough penetration and scaling to stay relevant late.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy draft has repeated backline access (double dive or blink support + assassin).
- You are being forced to spend relics on cooldown in early skirmishes.
- Your team wins longer fights if you survive first engage.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Sands of Time
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Pendulum of the Ages
2. Book of Thoth
3. Spear of Desolation
4. Magi's Cloak
5. Rod of Tahuti
6. Obsidian Shard
7. Time-lock Aegis

## Purchase checkpoints

1. If enemy jungle is fed, bring Magi's online by your 4th completed slot.
2. Keep one penetration slot active before late objective contests.
3. Upgrade defensive relic path earlier when dying before second cast cycle.

## Why this works

- Magi's Cloak blocks the first key CC layer that usually starts Sol's death chain.
- Time-lock Aegis adds emergency survive value after OB29 tuning, still useful into burst.
- Book + Rod + Obsidian preserves high-end threat so you are not only a defensive passenger.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game (levels 1-8)

1. Play toward warded side and keep `Disapparate` for confirmed danger.
2. Thin wave safely; do not overtrade just to force tiny HP leads.
3. Ping missing timers early and refuse blind river fights without vision.

## Mid game (levels 9-16)

1. Move with support or jungler, not alone through dark jungle corridors.
2. Hold `Supernova` to punish committed divers or guaranteed setup, not to fish.
3. Kite backward through your own team; make divers overextend into peel.

## Late game (17+)

1. Position one screen behind your frontline on objective setup.
2. First damage cycle is peel-first if assassins are still alive.
3. After enemy dive tools are spent, retarget carries and close fight with sustained DPS.

## Fast swaps

- Need more anti-dive DR/protections: Spirit Robe over Spear of Desolation.
- Need extra anti-magical pressure: Void Stone over Spear of Desolation.
- Enemy dive threat collapses late: sell Magi's Cloak for Soul Gem or Bancroft's Talon.
