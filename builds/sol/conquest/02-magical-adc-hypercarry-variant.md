# Conquest Build 02: Magical ADC Hypercarry Variant (Duo Sol)

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the magical basic-attack hypercarry route for Sol in duo lane.
It prioritizes sustained DPS, chase uptime, and high late-game objective burn while keeping enough intelligence scaling to punish grouped fights.

## When to lock this build

- Your team already has reliable physical damage from jungle/solo.
- You can play a farm-heavy duo lane and reach 3+ items on pace.
- Enemy comp lacks layered hard dive that can repeatedly force both relics.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Death's Toll
2. Gem (tier piece)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Multi Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Death's Embrace
2. Bancroft's Talon
3. Bracer of the Abyss
4. Rod of Tahuti
5. Nimble Ring
6. Hastened Fatalis
7. Obsidian Shard

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First spike: Death's Embrace + Bancroft for lane sustain and safer boxing.
2. Mid spike: add Bracer + Rod before long 5v5s and major objective flips.
3. Hypercarry spike: Nimble + Hastened turns fights into sustained chase/cleanup windows.

## Why this works

- OB29 Conquest carry bonus gold on minion last hit rewards disciplined farm routes.
- Death's Embrace and Bancroft stabilize lane attrition so Sol can keep DPS uptime.
- Bracer + Nimble + Hastened converts Sol into a high-tempo magical AA threat.
- Obsidian keeps your damage from collapsing into tank-heavy frontlines.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game (levels 1-8)

1. Play for wave control and last-hit consistency over low-value all-ins.
2. Trade around cooldown windows, then disengage before enemy support re-engages.
3. Use `Disapparate` reactively; if you spend it first, disengage and reset wave.

## Mid game (levels 9-16)

1. Rotate only after duo wave is secured; protect your farm lead.
2. Hit frontliners only when safe, then switch to nearest carry when spacing breaks.
3. Avoid deep flank paths without relics; your job is sustained DPS, not first contact.

## Late game (17+)

1. Front-to-back teamfighting is the default win condition.
2. Start objectives only when enemy engage tools are tracked.
3. Keep kiting angles open so `Hastened Fatalis` can convert one pick into full chase.

## Relics and upgrades

- Default: Beads + Aegis.
- Into low hard-CC lobbies: Blink second relic is viable for aggressive cleanup.
- Into heavy burst: Aegis upgrade before greed item pivots.

## Fast swaps

- Need anti-heal: Divine Ruin over Bracer of the Abyss.
- Need anti-dive: Magi's Cloak over Hastened Fatalis.
- Need safer burst trade: Polynomicon over Hastened Fatalis.
