# Core Mechanics, Skill Order, Combos, Positioning, and Relics (Medusa)

## What actually defines Medusa in SMITE 2

- **Passive (Sidewinder) changes how you kite**: no strafe movement penalty and only half backpedal penalty. This is why Medusa can keep firing while repositioning better than many Hunters.
- **Basic Attack profile matters for target selection**: Medusa basics are projectiles that stop on first target and do not pass through walls. Frontline body-blocking is a real DPS limiter.
- **1 (Viper Shot) is both DPS and cooldown engine**: it buffs attack speed and adds DoT to basic attacks; hitting enemy gods reduces Viper Shot cooldown, which rewards disciplined boxing and target access.
- **2 (Acid Spray) is your lane/control breakpoint tool**: line shot into cone explosion behind first hit target, includes healing reduction, and can be detonated on Medusa statues.
- **3 (Lacerate) is your safety valve and statue trigger**: dash damages minions, roots first enemy god hit, and instantly destroys Medusa statues.
- **4 (Petrify) is more than a stun**: enemies facing Medusa are stunned and become vulnerable (+damage taken), enemies not facing are slowed and deal less damage. Medusa is CC-immune while casting. God kills in Petrify’s post-hit window can create statues, and statue destruction gives major tempo rewards (temporary steroids; plus permanent stat gain when Medusa breaks statues with basics).

## Ability quick-sheet (numbers that affect decisions)

- **Basic Attack**: `40 (+2.5/lvl) (+100% STR) (+20% INT)` and 1.0 base attack speed progression. Practical takeaway: Medusa benefits from both pure AA scaling and mixed scaling windows from abilities.
- **1 (Viper Shot)**:
  - Duration: `6s`
  - Attack speed bonus: `10/15/20/25/30%`
  - Added poison damage per tick: `8/14/20/26/32 (+8% STR) (+8% INT)` every `0.5s` for `1.5s`
  - Cooldown: `14s` (reduced by `1s` per enemy god hit)
- **2 (Acid Spray)**:
  - Damage: `90/145/200/255/310 (+50% STR) (+80% INT)`
  - Applies healing reduction: `25%` for `5s`
  - Cooldown: `14s`
- **3 (Lacerate)**:
  - Damage: `80/130/180/230/280 (+75% STR) (+40% INT)`
  - Root duration: `1s`
  - Cooldown: `16/15.5/15/14.5/14s`
- **4 (Petrify)**:
  - Damage: `300/450/600/750/900 (+100% STR) (+180% INT)`
  - Cone angle: `40°`
  - Cooldown: `90s`

## Recommended leveling

## Conquest default (most consistent)

1. Level ult whenever possible: **5 / 9 / 13 / 17 / 20**
2. Max **2 (Acid Spray)** first
3. Max **1 (Viper Shot)** second
4. Max **3 (Lacerate)** last

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 2
- L2: 1
- L3: 3
- L4: 2
- L5: 4

Why this order:
- 2 gives reliable wave control, ranged poke, and anti-heal value from early lane states onward.
- 1 scales your sustained boxing and objective DPS once fights are more frequent.
- 3 is high utility, but its rank-up damage value is usually less important than 2/1 for carry economy.

## Arena / constant-fight variant

1. Level ult whenever possible
2. Max **1 (Viper Shot)** first if fights are nonstop and you can free-fire
3. Max **2 (Acid Spray)** second
4. Max **3 (Lacerate)** last

Rule of thumb:
- If you need safer poke/clear and anti-heal uptime, keep **2-first**.
- If your comp peels well and you can stand and shred, **1-first** can outperform.

## Core combo package

## Lane poke and clear (low risk)

1. Position so a front minion is between you and enemy carry
2. Cast **2** through that target to cone onto backline gods
3. Activate **1** and weave basics while Sidewinder-kiting
4. Hold **3** unless enemy jungler location is confirmed

## Standard all-in (when enemy beads/aegis are down)

1. Pre-angle flank so enemies are likely to be facing you late
2. **4 (Petrify)** to force hard CC or debuff state
3. Immediately **2** for burst + anti-heal
4. Pop **1** and finish with basic chain
5. Use **3** as follow or exit based on enemy cooldowns

## Anti-dive self-peel sequence

1. Keep **3** available when assassins are missing on map
2. If diver commits, **3** to root and create spacing
3. Drop **2** in retreat line (or on statue if present)
4. Use **4** reactively if diver is still facing into you
5. Re-kite with Sidewinder movement profile

## Statue conversion sequence (high-value mechanic)

1. Secure a Petrify-window kill to spawn statue
2. Decide instantly:
   - **Basic attack destroy** statue if you can do it safely for permanent scaling value
   - **Ability destroy** statue (often with 3/2 setup) when immediate tempo matters for chase/reset
3. Use temporary movement/attack-speed steroid window to force next objective or second pick

## Positioning rules that win games

- **Play diagonals, not straight lines**: Sidewinder gives Medusa exceptional lateral firing; abuse angled kiting paths.
- **Respect body-block geometry**: because your basics stop on first target, reposition before committing Viper Shot uptime into tanks.
- **Treat 3 as a permission tool**: if dash is down and enemy engage is up, your lane posture should become conservative.
- **Petrify is an angle check**: narrow cone rewards side entry and timing around enemy camera attention, not front-to-back panic ults.
- **After statue spawn, call tempo**: statues are mini-objectives; communicate whether team should hold area for safe break or continue chase.

## Relic choices (SMITE 2 one-relic framework)

- **Purification Beads** (default into hard-CC comps): safest anti-chain-CC choice.
- **Aegis of Acceleration** (anti-burst): damage immunity plus movement utility; strong when enemy comp is delete-first.
- **Blink Rune** (proactive pick angle): enables surprising Petrify lines and reposition plays; higher execution requirement.
- **Phantom Shell** (teamfight utility): valuable when team needs mitigation + anti-collision movement in heavy brawl spaces.
- **Agility Relic** (kiting greed option): useful for ranged AA pacing and repositioning, but generally greedier than Beads/Aegis in high-threat lobbies.

Relic selection heuristic:
- If enemy has reliable hard-CC picks: **Beads**.
- If enemy has burst ult chains: **Aegis**.
- If your team needs engage and you are ahead: **Blink**.
- If fights are front-to-back grind and your team groups often: **Phantom Shell**.

## What is sourced vs inferred

- **Directly sourced**: ability/relic mechanics, control effects, statue interactions, and relic system constraints.
- **Inferred (coaching layer)**: skill priority recommendations, combo sequencing, and positioning heuristics derived from those mechanics.
