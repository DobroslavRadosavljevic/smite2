Date anchored: 2026-02-25

## Patch status

- Current official patch window: OB29 - The Dark Enchantress Update.
- Official OB29 publish timestamp (CMS): 2026-02-23T17:52:17.056Z.

Official Medusa mention checks in recent notes:
- OB29 (`open-beta-29-update-notes`) has 0 Medusa mentions.
- OB28 (`open-beta-28-update-notes`) has 0 Medusa mentions.
- OB27 (`open-beta-27-update-notes`) has 1 Medusa mention.
- Latest explicit Medusa line found in this window is OB27: Viper Shot (1) damage-over-time was reduced (12/19/26/33/40 -> 10/15/20/25/30).

## Confidence tiers used

- Tier 1 (highest): official SMITE 2 patch notes URLs and official CMS payloads/timestamps.
- Tier 2: official SMITE 2 Wiki god/mode mechanics and wiki revision metadata.
- Tier 3: SmiteSource Medusa build pages and OB29 patch tagging for practical convergence.
- Tier 4: supporting community sources (SMITEFire, Smitebrain, Tacter).

## What can be asserted safely

- OB29 is the active patch anchor for Medusa build recommendations.
- No new Medusa-specific buff/nerf lines were found in OB28 or OB29 official notes.
- OB27 contains the latest explicit Medusa balance line in the sampled official patch window.
- Build choices should still be adapted by lobby context (enemy dive, frontline density, anti-heal needs).

## What should not be asserted

- A single mathematically absolute best Medusa build for every queue and skill bracket.
- Any claimed OB29 Medusa-specific buff/nerf without a first-party line in official notes/CMS payloads.
