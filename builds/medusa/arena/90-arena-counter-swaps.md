# Arena Counter Swaps (Medusa)

## Swap order rule

In Arena, counter earlier than Conquest because fights are constant and reset windows are short.

Recommended replacement order:
- slot 6 -> slot 5
- then slot 4 if you are still getting hard-countered

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing/sustain | Brawler's Beat Stick (ability shell), Contagion (when bruisers lifesteal off you) | Barbed Carver or Musashi's Dual Swords |
| Double tank / armor stack | The Executioner + Qin's Blade + Titan's Bane timing earlier | Crit greed slot or late utility slot |
| Crit carry deleting fights | Spectral Armor, Hide of the Nemean Lion | Barbed Carver or Musashi's Dual Swords |
| Hard-CC chains | Talisman of Purification, Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe | Greedy damage slot |
| Burst dive / one-shot entries | Time-lock Aegis, Circe's Hexstone, Dwarven Plate | Last damage spike item |

## Arena-specific micro rules

1. Medusa already applies 25% Healing Reduction with Acid Spray, but you still buy item anti-heal if enemy sustain has multiple sources.
2. If you die before second spell cycle twice in a row, convert one damage slot into defense immediately.
3. If tanks survive your full 3 -> 2 -> basic -> ult sequence, accelerate Executioner/Qin's/Titan timing before more crit.

## Relic adaptation quick map

- High hard-CC: Purification Beads -> Talisman of Purification.
- High burst: Aegis of Acceleration -> Time-lock Aegis.
- Safe flank access: Blink Rune -> Blinking Abyss.
