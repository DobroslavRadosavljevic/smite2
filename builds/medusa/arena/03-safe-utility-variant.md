# Arena Build 03: Safe Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.68 (Medium)

## Build identity

Use this when you are being hard-focused and need higher fight-to-fight uptime.
It keeps enough DPS to threaten tanks while adding safer re-entry tools.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy draft has repeated dive with layered CC.
- You are losing fights by dying before second Viper Shot cycle.
- Your team needs stable front-to-back damage more than coinflip burst.

## Full item order

## Start (Arena)

1. Death's Toll
2. Bow (tier component for auto path)
3. Health Potion
4. Purification Beads

## Core progression

1. Death's Embrace
2. The Executioner
3. Qin's Blade
4. Odysseus' Bow
5. Titan's Bane
6. Riptalon
7. Circe's Hexstone

Relic preference:
- Beads first into heavy CC
- Aegis path second into burst/dive comps

## Why this works

- Death's Embrace improves sustain and non-ultimate cooldown cadence in long Arena fights.
- Executioner + Qin's + Titan's keeps frontline damage online without all-in crit variance.
- Circe's Hexstone gives a defensive active with CC immunity, protection swing, and peel value.

## Playstyle plan

1. Front-to-back first, then flank only after enemy engage cooldowns are spent.
2. Keep Viper Shot for committed damage windows, not random poke trades.
3. Use Circe active proactively when divers collapse, not as a panic late cast.
4. If your team is ahead on tickets, maintain spacing and force enemies to overextend.

## Risk controls

- If your damage is too low into squishies, swap Riptalon to Deathbringer.
- If CC chains still lock you down, replace Riptalon with Magi's Cloak.
