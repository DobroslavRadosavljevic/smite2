# Arena Build 02: Aggressive Burst Variant

Confidence: 0.62 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the high-risk Medusa burst path for lobbies where you can repeatedly force carry picks.
It combines ability-confirm windows with crit finishers for fast kill conversions.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy backline has weak peel or poor relic discipline.
- You are winning early skirmishes and can keep tempo.
- Your team already has frontline control so you can play for finish windows.

## Full item order

## Start (Arena)

1. Bluestone Pendant
2. Axe
3. Health Potion
4. Blink Rune (or Beads into hard-CC chains)

## Core progression

1. Bluestone Brooch
2. Hydra's Lament
3. Jotunn's Revenge
4. Demon Blade
5. Deathbringer
6. Titan's Bane
7. Musashi's Dual Swords

Frontline-heavy adjustment:
- Swap Musashi's Dual Swords for Heartseeker.

## Why this works

- Hydra's Lament rewards Medusa ability -> basic weave patterns.
- Demon Blade + Deathbringer + Musashi gives fast crit conversion after root/stun confirms.
- Titan's Bane prevents full armor stack from hard-stopping your kill window.

## Playstyle plan

1. Poke first, then commit when Beads/Aegis are down.
2. Use Lacerate to force positioning errors and immediately weave a boosted basic.
3. Fire Petrify when enemies are likely facing your frontline, then collapse instantly.
4. If first engage fails, disengage and wait for cooldown cycle; do not force second entry blind.

## Abort conditions

- If you die before second cast cycle in two straight fights, pivot to one defensive slot immediately.
- If enemy tanks are soaking full combo, bring in Heartseeker earlier and reduce crit greed.
