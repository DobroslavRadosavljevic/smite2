# Arena Build 01: OB29-Adjusted Default (Ability Pressure)

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the best-supported practical Arena default for Medusa in the OB29 window.
It keeps the most consistent Medusa ability-pressure shell from current public build pages, then adapts it for Arena pacing.

## Evidence boundary

- Direct Medusa build pages found in this pass are mostly tagged Open Beta 27/28.
- This setup is an OB29-adjusted adaptation, not a direct OB29 Arena-only feed.

## When to lock this build

- Standard Arena lobbies where you need reliable poke plus pick confirm.
- Enemy backline is reachable with side-angle engages.
- Your team benefits from early anti-heal pressure through Medusa's kit plus item burst.

## Full item order

## Start (Arena)

1. Bluestone Pendant
2. Axe (tier component for Strength path)
3. Health Potion
4. Purification Beads (Blink Rune if enemy hard-CC is low)

## Core progression

1. Bluestone Brooch
2. Jotunn's Revenge
3. Transcendence
4. The Crusher
5. Heartseeker
6. Titan's Bane
7. Barbed Carver

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Get Bluestone Brooch + Jotunn online before forcing constant centerline fights.
2. Transcendence + Crusher is your stable mid-game pressure point.
3. Heartseeker + Titan's Bane is your anti-frontline timing; do not delay it into double tanks.

## Why this works

- Medusa has built-in anti-heal on Acid Spray, so she can pressure sustain comps early.
- Viper Shot + ability-hit items create steady poke/execute pressure every fight.
- Titan's Bane + Heartseeker keeps damage relevant when Arena fights become front-to-back.

## Playstyle plan

1. Play side angles so Petrify hits players who are still facing your team.
2. Use Lacerate as a confirm/escape tool, not as a blind engage.
3. Save Petrify for relic punish windows or guaranteed statue conversions.
4. If you are ahead on tickets, prioritize safe poke and disengage over deep chase.
