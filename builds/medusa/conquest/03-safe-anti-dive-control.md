# Conquest Build 03: Safe Anti-Dive Control

Confidence: 0.79 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This variant is for games where living through first contact matters more than maximum DPS.
It keeps Medusa damage relevant while adding sustain and anti-dive stability.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy jungle + solo can reliably force your relics every fight.
- Enemy support has hard engage chain setup.
- Your team wins fights if you survive and output a second damage cycle.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Bluestone Pendant (or Corrupted Bluestone route)
2. Mace
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Bluestone Brooch
2. Jotunn's Vigor
3. Evolved Soul Eater
4. The Crusher
5. Heartseeker
6. Titan's Bane
7. Relics: Temporal Beads + Aegis of Acceleration (Shell if your team needs anti-burst cover)

## Control/survival flex

- Brawler's Beat Stick over Heartseeker when enemy healing decides fights.
- Blackthorn Hammer over Heartseeker in extreme dive games.

## Why this works on Medusa

- Soul Eater sustain helps you keep uptime after first engage.
- Lacerate root plus Petrify stun/CC-immune cast gives strong self-peel when divers overcommit.
- You still keep core anti-frontline pressure with Crusher + Heartseeker + Titan's Bane timing.

## Playstyle plan

## Early

1. Prioritize safe wave control and avoid relic-forcing trades before jungle info.
2. Keep Lacerate for anti-gank unless kill is guaranteed.
3. Track enemy blink timers; respect support fog angles.

## Mid

1. Fight near your peel line, not isolated side angles.
2. Save Petrify for committed dive or high-value turn, not poke.
3. Use Acid Spray to pressure grouped entries and healing windows.

## Late

1. Survive first collapse, then re-enter with Viper Shot and front-to-back autos.
2. Do not overextend for one kill if relics are down.
3. Convert won defensive fights into objective calls immediately.
