# Conquest Build 01: OB29 Best-Supported Default (Carry)

Confidence: 0.82 (High)

## Build identity

This is the most repeatable Medusa Conquest carry default from current public match data.
It is an ability-pressured carry spine that still scales into front-to-back late fights.

## Evidence snapshot

Observed carry-card frequency on `prosmitebuilds.com/medusa` (94 carry cards, patch 12.1 page snapshot):
- Heartseeker: 57
- The Crusher: 52
- Jotunn's Vigor: 48
- Fail-not: 42
- Titan's Bane: 20
- Bluestone Brooch starter path: 39 (plus 26 Corrupted Bluestone)

## When to lock this build

- You want stable lane pressure without full crit greed.
- Enemy comp has at least one frontline target you must break.
- Your team needs reliable mid-game objective DPS, not only late 6-item boxing.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Bluestone Pendant
2. Mace (Jotunn tier path)
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Bluestone Brooch
2. Jotunn's Vigor
3. The Crusher
4. Heartseeker
5. Titan's Bane
6. Fail-not
7. Upgrade relics: Temporal Beads + Aegis of Acceleration

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First back: secure Jotunn path pieces and keep lane tempo with safer poke.
2. Mid game: finish Crusher + Heartseeker before forced 5v5 objective flips.
3. Late game: do not delay Titan's Bane if 2+ enemies are stacking protections.

## Why this works on Medusa

- Viper Shot rewards attack speed and repeated hit windows, so Jotunn + Crusher tempo is high value.
- Acid Spray already pressures healing windows, and this build keeps enough burst to convert that pressure.
- Lacerate plus Petrify gives self-peel and turn potential, so you can run aggressive damage slots without full glass-cannon relic greed.

## Playstyle plan

## Early

1. Use Acid Spray + autos to force sustain pressure and lane priority.
2. Keep Lacerate for escape unless enemy relics are already down.
3. Avoid blind all-ins before Beads timing is stable.

## Mid

1. Rotate with support after wave control; do not overchase side picks.
2. Fight from angles where Petrify can punish turns, not from front-center choke points.
3. Commit ult after enemy mobility/relic information is clear.

## Late

1. Front-to-back with Titan's Bane uptime on tanks first.
2. Hold Lacerate as anti-dive disengage unless kill is guaranteed.
3. Use Petrify as a punish tool on engages, not a random opener into full relics.

## Fast adaptations

- Need stronger anti-heal now: Brawler's Beat Stick over Fail-not or Heartseeker.
- Need more on-hit tank burn: Envenomed Executioner over Fail-not.
- Need safer sustain into dive: Evolved Soul Eater over Fail-not.
