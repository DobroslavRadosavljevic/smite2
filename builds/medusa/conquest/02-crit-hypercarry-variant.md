# Conquest Build 02: Crit Hypercarry Variant

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the higher-variance Medusa carry variant for hard late-game boxing.
It pivots from utility burst into crit and on-hit amplification once lane is stable.

## When to lock this build

- You are even or ahead by second item timing.
- Your team can peel long enough for extended basic attack uptime.
- Enemy draft is not full hard-dive with guaranteed backline collapse.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Death's Toll
2. Mace
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Potion
5. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Death's Temper
2. Crimson Claws
3. Fail-not
4. Envenomed Executioner
5. Qin's Sais
6. Devoted Deathbringer
7. Upgrade relics: Temporal Beads + Aegis of Acceleration

## Optional greed route (when very ahead)

- Ornate Arrow -> Crimson Claws -> Evolved Rage -> Devoted Deathbringer

## Purchase checkpoints

1. First spike: Death's Temper + Crimson Claws online.
2. Mid spike: Fail-not + Executioner turns every ult-confirm into higher team crit pressure.
3. Late spike: Deathbringer slot completed, then decide between Odysseus' Bow or Titan's Bane flex.

## Why this works on Medusa

- Viper Shot amplifies auto-trade windows, so crit/on-hit chains scale hard in committed fights.
- Fail-not lines up with Petrify follow-up, creating high-probability burst windows.
- Executioner + Qin's keeps this build from collapsing completely into high-HP targets.

## Risk profile

- Strongest ceiling of the three builds.
- Most punishable when behind or when enemy dive reaches you before Beads/Aegis windows.

## Playstyle plan

1. Farm cleanly until first two-item spike; do not force coin-flip fights.
2. Use Petrify reactively to create guaranteed free-hit windows.
3. In late fights, keep front-to-back discipline unless enemy carry is fully exposed.

## Fast swaps

- Need anti-heal now: Brawler's Beat Stick over Deathbringer or Odysseus flex.
- Need anti-tank pen: Titan's Bane over Deathbringer when enemy armor stacks early.
- Need safer anti-dive: Evolved Soul Eater over Deathbringer in unstable games.
