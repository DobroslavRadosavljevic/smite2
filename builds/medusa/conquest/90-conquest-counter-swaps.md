# Conquest Counter Swaps (Medusa)

## Swap order rule

Default replacement priority:
- slot 6 -> slot 5 -> slot 4

Keep at least one anti-frontline slot active:
- Titan's Bane or Envenomed Executioner or Qin's Sais

Keep at least one safety lever active:
- Temporal/Purification Beads + Aegis/Shell

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing frontline/support | Brawler's Beat Stick (earlier, slot 4-5) | Fail-not or Heartseeker |
| Double tank / high-HP stacking | Envenomed Executioner + Qin's Sais + Titan's Bane earlier | Fail-not or one crit greed slot |
| Assassin + warrior hard dive | Evolved Soul Eater, Blackthorn Hammer, Shell relic path | Devoted Deathbringer or other greed finisher |
| Hard CC engage chains | Temporal/Greater Purification Beads first, keep Aegis second | Damage greed slot before pen slots |
| Need stronger objective burn | Odysseus' Bow or Qin's package in front-to-back games | Fail-not if ult-crit value is low |
| You are ahead and can free-hit | Crit package: Crimson Claws + Fail-not + Devoted Deathbringer | Brawler's/utility slot if anti-heal not required |
| You are behind and getting collapsed | Return to safety spine: Soul Eater + Crusher + Heartseeker + Titan's | Crit finisher first |

## Relic adaptation quick map

- Default safe: Purification/Temporal Beads + Aegis of Acceleration.
- Into repeated burst engages: keep Aegis, do not greed Blink.
- Into heavy melee collapse where team needs cover: Shell as second relic option.

## Build-family swap shortcuts

- Default -> anti-dive: add Soul Eater, keep Beads/Aegis timings strict.
- Default -> crit hypercarry: transition through Crimson Claws + Fail-not only when stable.
- Crit -> emergency stabilize: drop Deathbringer/greed slot for Soul Eater or anti-heal.
