# SMITE 2 Build Library 🎯⚔️📚

Generated on: 2026-02-25 (UTC)

## Scope 🧭

This folder contains focused build playbooks, split by god and game mode.
Each package includes research notes, confidence levels, and practical swap logic for real lobbies.

## Available Gods 🛡️🔥

- [Thanatos](./thanatos/README.md)
- [Anubis](./anubis/README.md)

## Research Notes 🔎🧪

- Current patch context verified against official SMITE 2 sources (OB29, published February 23, 2026).
- SMITE 2 Wiki was used for god and item mechanics.
- Public build sources were used for convergence and practical variants.
- Exa MCP was attempted first but failed during this run with decode errors, so direct source retrieval was used as fallback.

## Folder Conventions 🗂️✅

- `97-*`: important source links and API endpoints
- `98-*`: evidence quality and confidence notes
- `99-*`: core mechanics, skill orders, and combo guides
- `01/02/03-*`: primary build variants by mode
- `90-*`: quick counter-swap matrix by mode
