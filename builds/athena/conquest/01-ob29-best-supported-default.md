# Conquest Build 01: OB29 Best-Supported Default

Confidence: 0.79 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the highest-supported Athena Support baseline for the current OB29 window.
It is anchored to the newest SmiteSource Support baseline (Open Beta 28, updated February 24, 2026) and cross-checked with Athena-specific Support pages from Open Beta 27/26.

Primary goal:
- stable engage timing
- strong anti-crit insurance
- enough anti-CC and team utility to survive long objective fights

## When to lock this build

- Enemy draft is mixed damage and not full all-in dive.
- Your comp wants reliable front-to-back teamfights.
- You need one default path that can pivot into anti-burst or initiation variants.

## Full item order

## Start

1. War Flag
2. Sash
3. Phantom Shell
4. Health Chalice
5. Health Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. War Banner
2. Yogi's Necklace
3. Dwarven Plate
4. Glorious Pridwen
5. Shell of Rebuke
6. Spectral Armor
7. Magi's Cloak
8. Blink Rune (second relic timing)

## Buy flow and checkpoints

1. First recall:
   - Finish `War Banner` if your lane is stable.
   - If gold is short, buy efficient defense components and reset quickly.
2. Second recall:
   - Start and complete `Yogi's Necklace` before repeated 5v5s.
3. Mid-game core:
   - Build `Dwarven Plate` -> `Glorious Pridwen` for first durable engage breakpoint.
4. Teamfight stabilization:
   - Add `Shell of Rebuke` before enemy burst hits full spike.
5. Late game safety:
   - `Spectral Armor` once hunter crit is online.
   - `Magi's Cloak` as final anti-pick/anti-chain-CC layer.
6. Relic flow:
   - Keep `Phantom Shell` as first relic.
   - Buy `Blink Rune` once your backline can instantly follow taunt engages.

## How to play

## Early

1. Use `Preemptive Strike (1)` for controlled trades and space, not random all-ins.
2. Save `Confound (2)` to punish oversteps or protect ADC from jungle entries.
3. Do not overspend mana on poke; prioritize wave control and safe reset timings.

## Mid

1. Engage from fog with `Blink Rune` -> `Confound (2)` -> `Shield Wall (3)`.
2. Hold taunt for carry access denial when enemy divers are fed.
3. Use `Defender of Olympus (4)` proactively to swing side-lane skirmishes before objectives.

## Late

1. Frontline with peel priority when enemy assassins commit.
2. Track relic cooldowns before hard Blink commits.
3. Avoid solo facechecks; preserve `Magi's Cloak` passive value for real engage windows.

## Fast adaptation triggers

- No crit threat: `Spectral Armor` -> `Spirit Robe` or `Oni Hunter's Garb`.
- Heavy magical burst: `Dwarven Plate` or `Spectral Armor` -> `Genji's Guard`.
- Need harder engage pace: move `Stampede` in over `Yogi's Necklace` or `Dwarven Plate`.
