# Conquest Counter Swaps (Athena)

## Swap order rule

Default replacement priority:
- Slot 7 -> Slot 6 -> Slot 5

Keep these minimums active after swaps:
- one anti-CC layer (`Magi's Cloak` or `Spirit Robe`)
- one anti-burst tool (`Shell of Rebuke`, `Time-lock Aegis`, or `Heroism` path)
- one engage lever (`Blink Rune`, `Stampede`, or `Screeching Gargoyle`)

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crit ADC snowball | Spectral Armor, Spectral Visage | Yogi's Necklace, Dwarven Plate | Immediate crit dampening beats extra generic stats. |
| Heavy healing (solo + support + lifesteal carries) | Contagion | Scepter of Dominion or Yogi's Necklace | Teamwide anti-heal is higher value than extra utility slot. |
| Chain hard-CC lock comps | Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe, Talisman of Purification | Spectral Armor (if no crit), Dwarven Plate | Prevents getting deleted before taunt/ult value. |
| Triple magical burst | Genji's Guard, Oni Hunter's Garb | Spectral Armor, Yogi's Necklace | Magic mitigation and CDR sustain long fights. |
| Backline dive assassins | Shell of Rebuke, Time-lock Aegis, Heroism | Greedy engage slot (Screeching Gargoyle/Circe's) | Surviving first dive cycle is the win condition. |
| Kite-heavy comps (Hecate/Archer backline spacing) | Stampede, Blink Rune | Dwarven Plate, slower utility slot | Closing distance reliably matters more than passive tank stats. |
| Front-to-back tank walls | Prophetic Cloak (earlier), Dwarven Plate, Glorious Pridwen | Lowest-impact utility slot | Better sustained uptime and repeated engage durability. |
| Objective race and secure fights | Sundering Arc, Scepter of Dominion | Lowest-impact late utility slot | Adds decisive fight/objective impact during commits. |

## Relic adaptation quick map

- Default control: `Phantom Shell` + `Blink Rune`.
- Burst survival priority: add or rush `Time-lock Aegis`.
- High-CC picks: consider `Talisman of Purification` if Beads-style immunity is required.
- Objective secure pressure: `Sundering Arc` when your team needs stronger objective burst.
