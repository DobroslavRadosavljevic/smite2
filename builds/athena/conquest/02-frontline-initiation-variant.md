# Conquest Build 02: Frontline Initiation Variant

Confidence: 0.75 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the high-tempo engage variant for Athena Support.
It leans into movement and active-item initiation so you can start fights first and force relics early.

## When to lock this build

- Your team needs you to be first contact every fight.
- You have burst follow-up (jungle/mid) that can instantly punish taunt setups.
- Enemy backline lacks consistent anti-dive peel.

## Full item order

## Start

1. War Flag
2. Sash
3. Phantom Shell
4. Health Chalice
5. Health Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. War Banner
2. Stampede
3. Screeching Gargoyle
4. Glorious Pridwen
5. Circe's Hexstone
6. Spirit Robe
7. Magi's Cloak
8. Blink Rune

## Buy flow and checkpoints

1. First recall:
   - Rush `War Banner` for lane pressure and faster group rotations.
2. Early skirmish checkpoint:
   - Complete `Stampede` before first major jungle/river fight.
3. First hard-engage spike:
   - Add `Screeching Gargoyle` to secure initiation control.
4. Mid-game durability:
   - `Glorious Pridwen` then `Circe's Hexstone` for frontline sticking power.
5. Late safety layers:
   - `Spirit Robe` -> `Magi's Cloak` to avoid getting neutralized on entry.
6. Relic timing:
   - `Blink Rune` once your team is synced to fight on your first taunt.

## How to play

## Pre-fight setup

1. Start fights from flank fog, not front vision.
2. Call engage target before blinking so damage lands during taunt.
3. Save one defensive cooldown for your exit path after first commit.

## Engage sequence

1. Trigger `Stampede` just before contact.
2. `Blink Rune` behind priority target.
3. `Confound (2)` immediately.
4. `Shield Wall (3)` under taunted target(s).
5. Use `Preemptive Strike (1)` to cut escape angles or peel counter-dive.

## Mid/Late teamfights

1. If first engage fails, reset quickly and look for second taunt timer.
2. Use `Defender of Olympus (4)` to join side pressure into instant 5v4s.
3. Do not hold actives too long; this build wins by pace, not by attrition.

## Risk profile

- Lower passive durability than anti-burst utility setups.
- If enemy CC chain is heavy, move to safer swaps earlier (Magi's/Spirit timing).

## Recovery swaps

- Into extreme mage burst: `Screeching Gargoyle` or `Circe's Hexstone` -> `Genji's Guard`/`Oni Hunter's Garb`.
- If your team cannot follow engages: replace one proactive slot with `Shell of Rebuke`.
