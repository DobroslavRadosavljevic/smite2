# Conquest Build 03: Anti-Burst Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.77 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the low-variance Athena Support variant for burst-heavy lobbies.
It prioritizes mitigation, peel uptime, and anti-pick stability over maximum initiation tempo.

## When to lock this build

- Enemy comp has high assassin/mage burst and chain CC.
- Your carries are the main win condition and must be protected.
- You expect long objective fights where defensive actives decide outcomes.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Selflessness
2. Sash
3. Phantom Shell
4. Health Chalice
5. Health Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Upgrade Selflessness -> Heroism
2. Prophetic Cloak
3. Shell of Rebuke
4. Scepter of Dominion
5. Magi's Cloak
6. Spectral Armor
7. Time-lock Aegis
8. Blink Rune (optional second relic when your team needs proactive starts)

## Buy flow and checkpoints

1. First recall:
   - Prioritize `Heroism` path completion for immediate mitigation value.
2. Second recall:
   - Rush `Prophetic Cloak` to start stacking before full 5v5 phase.
3. First objective-cycle spike:
   - Add `Shell of Rebuke` to blunt enemy burst windows.
4. Mid game utility spike:
   - Build `Scepter of Dominion` for extra defensive/utility control in grouped fights.
5. Late game stabilization:
   - `Magi's Cloak` -> `Spectral Armor` for anti-chain-CC + anti-crit insurance.
6. Relic flow:
   - `Time-lock Aegis` when enemy burst is the primary threat.
   - Add `Blink Rune` later only if your team still needs hard engage.

## How to play

## Early

1. Short-trade and disengage; do not force deep lane commits.
2. Keep `Confound (2)` for peel if enemy jungle pathing is aggressive.
3. Maintain ward tempo and preserve HP for objective timers.

## Mid

1. Position close enough to peel carries, not just to dive enemy backline.
2. Use `Shell of Rebuke` and relics reactively to deny first burst cycle.
3. `Defender of Olympus (4)` should favor counter-engage and numbers rescue plays.

## Late

1. Fight front-to-back unless enemy backline is isolated for free taunt.
2. Hold taunt for highest-threat diver when your carries are pressured.
3. If your defensive layer absorbs first engage, re-enter with Blink for second-cycle control.

## Priority swaps inside this variant

- Low crit lobby: `Spectral Armor` -> `Genji's Guard` or `Oni Hunter's Garb`.
- Need anti-heal: replace `Scepter of Dominion` or `Spectral Armor` with `Contagion`.
- Need harder anti-CC: keep `Magi's Cloak` and add `Spirit Robe` over greed slots.
