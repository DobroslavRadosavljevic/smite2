# Arena Build 02: Aggressive Engage Variant

Confidence: 0.74 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is the high-tempo Athena line for forcing starts and punishing teams that cannot answer hard front-to-back engage.

It trades some late safety for:
- faster engage access
- stronger protection shred setup
- higher kill conversion when your team can instantly follow

## When to lock this build

- Your backline already has enough peel tools.
- Your comp has immediate follow-up burst on taunt targets.
- Enemy carries are immobile or already spending beads early.

## Full item order

## Start

1. War Flag
2. Medallion
3. Blink Rune
4. Health Chalice
5. Multi Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. War Banner
2. Stampede
3. Screeching Gargoyle
4. Stone of Binding
5. Glorious Pridwen
6. Circe's Hexstone
7. Freya's Tears

Default flex:
- Swap Freya's Tears to Spectral Armor against two-item crit.
- Swap Stone of Binding to Spirit Robe if you are getting hard-CC focused before second cycle.

## Why this works

- War Banner + Stampede frontloads movement/tempo so Athena can repeatedly find first contact.
- Screeching Gargoyle and Stone of Binding amplify your team's damage after taunt confirms.
- Glorious Pridwen and Circe's Hexstone add extra active pressure in the same engage window.
- Athena's taunt-duration scaling with protections still keeps this build from becoming paper-thin.

## Relic guidance

- Blink Rune is mandatory first relic in this variant.
- Second relic priority:
  - Purification Beads if enemy peel chain is stopping your entries.
  - Time-lock Aegis if you are being burst immediately after blink-taunt.
- Upgrade Blink earlier if you are consistently hitting backline entries.

## Engage macro rules

1. Path through side grass, not centerline vision.
2. Call target before commit and only blink when your follow-up damage is in range.
3. Standard entry: Preemptive Strike -> Confound -> Shield Wall -> Reach basic, then active item chain.
4. Exit after first cycle unless kill is guaranteed; Athena is more valuable alive for second taunt window.

## Ticket-efficiency rules

1. One clean pick is enough; do not give shutdown deaths trying to overfarm kills.
2. After a successful engage, convert to minion escort when portal lane is open.
3. Save at least one active for Minotaur fights instead of spending every cooldown on poke scraps.

## Risk controls

- If two engages in a row fail before your second ability cycle, buy a defense pivot immediately.
- If enemy backline is unreachable due to peel, stop forcing flanks and pivot into peel-plus-frontline burn.
