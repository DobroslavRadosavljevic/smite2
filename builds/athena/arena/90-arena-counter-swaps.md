# Arena Counter Swaps (Athena)

## Swap order rule

In Arena, counter pivots happen earlier than Conquest because fights are constant:

1. Replace slot 7 first (latest flex/greed slot).
2. Then replace slot 6 if counter pressure is still unresolved.
3. Replace slot 5 only when the matchup is fully invalidating your current line.

## Fast trigger checklist

Buy the counter immediately if any trigger appears:

1. You die before second ability cycle in two consecutive fights.
2. Enemy sustain wins two fights in a row.
3. Enemy crit carry reaches two crit items.
4. Enemy hard-CC chain repeatedly forces your relics before you can taunt.

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first | Trigger timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy sustain/lifesteal | Contagion | Yogi's Necklace or Freya's Tears | No later than item 4-5 |
| Crit backline threat | Spectral Armor | Freya's Tears or Eye/Scepter flex | Immediately at 2-crit-item spike |
| Hard CC chain comp | Magi's Cloak + Purification Beads | Greedy active slot (Circe/Scepter) | As soon as beads are forced pre-fight |
| Burst delete comp | Spirit Robe + Time-lock Aegis | Slow scaling slot | After first back-to-back burst deaths |
| Double tank frontline | Stone of Binding + Screeching Gargoyle | Pure sustain slot | When taunt targets are not dying |
| Dive-heavy melee stack | Shell of Rebuke + Stampede | Aggressive flank slot | Before next Minotaur fight |

## Relic adaptation map

- Default stable line: Purification Beads + Shell family (Phantom/Shell of Rebuke).
- Engage-heavy line: Blink Rune first, then Beads or Aegis depending on enemy control/burst.
- Burst-heavy enemy setup: Time-lock Aegis second relic even if you started Blink.
- If your engage succeeds but follow-up fails, keep Blink and swap items first, not relics first.

## Macro swap logic (Arena-specific)

## Ticket economy rules

1. God kill value is 5 tickets, so death prevention has huge value in close games.
2. Minion and portal pressure are 1 ticket each, so post-pick wave conversion matters.
3. Minotaur swings are 15 tickets every spawn cycle, so active/relic cooldowns should be planned around that fight.

## State-based calls

## When ahead (roughly +60 tickets or more)

1. Bias peel over deep chase.
2. Keep one major active for defensive turn.
3. Escort minions after picks instead of forcing second dives.

## When behind (roughly -60 tickets or more)

1. Force around no-relic enemy carry only.
2. Use Blink/taunt windows to isolate one target, then disengage.
3. Avoid full 5v5 front crashes without active advantage.

## Final 100-ticket zone

1. Do not spend all actives in pre-fight poke.
2. Hold Defender of Olympus for the first true commit.
3. Prioritize survival and guaranteed confirmations over style plays.
