# Arena Build 01: OB29-Adjusted Default

Confidence: 0.82 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the most stable Athena Arena baseline in the current OB29 environment:
- high frontline uptime
- reliable engage and peel
- strong team utility through active and aura-like effects

It is built around Athena's protection-scaling taunt value and Arena's constant 5v5 cadence.

## When to lock this build

- Standard Arena lobby with mixed damage profiles.
- Your team needs a true frontliner who can both start and stop fights.
- Enemy comp is not hard-committed to one single counter profile yet.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Selflessness
2. Medallion
3. Phantom Shell
4. Health Chalice
5. Vision Ward
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Heroism
2. Prophetic Cloak
3. Eye of Providence
4. Stampede
5. Glorious Pridwen
6. Spirit Robe
7. Freya's Tears

Default flex:
- Swap Freya's Tears to Spectral Armor versus early crit.
- Swap Eye of Providence to Contagion if enemy sustain is deciding fights.

## Why this works

- Athena's Confound gains extra taunt duration from item protections, so tank-heavy lines directly increase CC reliability.
- Prophetic Cloak and Heroism let you survive first contact, then re-engage on short Arena fight cycles.
- Stampede and Glorious Pridwen convert defensive stats into engage tempo and bursty follow-up for your team.
- Eye of Providence gives vision control that matters more in Arena side-jungle/bush flanks than people expect.

## Purchase checkpoints

1. Get Heroism online before repeated centerline 5v5s.
2. Buy Prophetic Cloak early enough to stack before late-ticket fights.
3. Once Stampede + Pridwen are online, you can force controlled engage windows more often.

## Relic guidance

- Default first relic: Phantom Shell for teamfight shielding and carry protection.
- If enemy chain-CC is high, buy Purification Beads first instead.
- Second relic priority:
  - Time-lock Aegis into burst-delete comps.
  - Blink Rune if your team lacks a reliable fight starter.

## Arena macro play

## Early phase (500 to ~350 tickets)

1. Anchor side of wave, not dead center, and threaten Dash -> Taunt angles.
2. Trade for relics, not kills, in first two fights.
3. Contest side buff entrances with Eye/ward vision instead of blind face-checking.

## Mid phase (~350 to ~120 tickets)

1. Track Minotaur timer windows and keep ult available for the commit fight.
2. Convert one kill (5 tickets) into minion escort pressure instead of overchasing.
3. Use Defender of Olympus as a turn tool when your carry is being dove.

## Late phase (~120 to 0 tickets)

1. If ahead, play peel-first and deny 5-ticket deaths.
2. If behind, force around enemy no-relic target only.
3. Keep one active item (Shell/Stampede/Pridwen) for the deciding fight rather than spending all at once.

## Win condition

- Win repeated medium-length fights by surviving first burst, forcing relics with taunt threat, and converting picks into ticket-efficient map pressure.
