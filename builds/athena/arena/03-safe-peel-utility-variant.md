# Arena Build 03: Safe Peel Utility Variant

Confidence: 0.79 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

Use this when your win condition is carry survival, not hard front-side dives.

This version emphasizes:
- anti-dive denial
- repeated defensive cooldown trading
- reliable late-ticket stabilization

## When to lock this build

- Enemy has double dive or reset assassins.
- Enemy burst is deleting your damage dealers before they cast.
- Your team already has enough engage but lacks defensive stability.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Selflessness
2. Sash
3. Purification Beads
4. Health Chalice
5. Health Potion
6. Bifrost Shard

## Core progression

1. Heroism
2. Prophetic Cloak
3. Shell of Rebuke
4. Magi's Cloak
5. Spirit Robe
6. Yogi's Necklace
7. Scepter of Dominion

Default flex:
- Swap Scepter of Dominion to Spectral Armor versus heavy crit.
- Swap Yogi's Necklace to Contagion versus high sustain/lifesteal drafts.

## Why this works

- Heroism and Selflessness both scale defensive shielding around ally protection.
- Magi's Cloak and Spirit Robe blunt hard-CC chain engages that normally remove Athena's peel window.
- Shell of Rebuke gives teamwide mitigation and shielding in clustered Arena fights.
- Scepter of Dominion adds controlled stasis space, buying time for your carries to reset.

## Relic guidance

- Purification Beads first is default for this variant.
- Second relic priority:
  - Time-lock Aegis vs burst delete.
  - Phantom Shell if your team needs more shared shielding and the enemy CC chain is manageable.
- Do not skip beads if enemy comp has reliable taunt/stun chains.

## Peeling macro play

1. Hold taunt for divers unless a guaranteed pick appears.
2. Use Preemptive Strike as body-block and interrupt tool, not only as engage gap-close.
3. Place Shield Wall on your carry's retreat path to punish overchasing melee targets.
4. Use Defender of Olympus to counter-engage and instantly rebalance collapsing fights.

## Ticket-state rules

1. Ahead: play deny mode, protect wave escorts, and avoid high-risk portal dives.
2. Even: trade actives for enemy actives first, then force the next cycle with relic advantage.
3. Behind: only full-commit when your carries are in position to convert the taunt.

## Win condition

- Outlast enemy dive windows, force bad overextensions, and win repeated cleanup fights off cooldown discipline.
