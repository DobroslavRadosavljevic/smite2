# Core Mechanics, Skill Order, and Combos

Date anchored: 2026-02-25 (OB29 context)

## Athena core identity

- Athena is a setup-and-control frontline whose biggest value is reliable hard engage (`Confound`) plus global rotation pressure (`Defender of Olympus`).
- Her strongest fights are the ones where she starts or denies one key target, then keeps that target in place for team follow-up.
- In Support-oriented play, your job is not top damage. Your job is to force clean, low-risk fights for your damage dealers.

## High-impact mechanics to play around

## Passive: `Reach`

- After any ability, Athena's next basic becomes ranged and passes through enemies/walls.
- That hit can crit and trigger item effects, with bonus damage to the first target hit.
- Practical rule: if you are safe, weave this empowered basic between ability casts for free extra pressure.

## `Preemptive Strike` (1)

- Has a short windup, then dashes, slowing enemies hit.
- On enemy god hit, Athena gains Physical and Magical Protections for a short window.
- It is both engage and escape. If you spend it to enter, be sure the kill/peel value is worth losing your safest exit.

## `Confound` (2)

- Main control tool: cone taunt with rank-scaling taunt duration.
- Taunt duration also scales from item protections, so protection-heavy builds increase practical lockdown time.
- This is the highest-value rank-up in control-focused support play.

## `Shield Wall` (3)

- Two-hit zone with a delay between hits; both hits apply slow.
- Best use is immediate placement on taunted targets so both hits connect.
- This is Athena's most reliable repeatable fight damage when enemies are controlled.

## `Defender of Olympus` (4)

- Global teleport to ally with shield + movement speed before landing damage.
- Channel is CC immune; if target dies during channel, Athena still lands at target location.
- Win condition mechanic: turn outnumbered skirmishes into equal or advantaged fights before they collapse.

## Aspect note: `Aspect of War`

- Ultimate targets visible enemies instead of allies, removes landing damage, and applies increased damage taken while channeling.
- Use this for pick-focused or dive-heavy comps that can burst a marked enemy on call.

## Skill leveling

## Default support/control order (Conquest + Arena frontline)

Priority:
1. Level ultimate whenever possible (`5/10/14/17/20`)
2. Max `2` (`Confound`) first
3. Max `3` (`Shield Wall`) second
4. Max `1` (`Preemptive Strike`) last

Level-by-level template:
- L1: `3`
- L2: `2` (swap to `1` only if you must survive early gank pressure)
- L3: `1`
- L4: `2`
- L5: `4`
- L6: `2`
- L7: `2`
- L8: `3`
- L9: `2`
- L10: `4`
- L11: `3`
- L12: `3`
- L13: `3`
- L14: `4`
- L15: `1`
- L16: `1`
- L17: `4`
- L18: `1`
- L19: `1`
- L20: `4`

Why this order:
- `2` first gives the biggest teamfight control jump (longer taunt windows).
- `3` second improves guaranteed follow-up damage after taunt setup.
- `1` usually functions as utility/survival timing rather than your primary damage button in support builds.

## Damage-leaning flex order (jungle/solo Athena)

Priority:
1. Ult on level breakpoints
2. Max `3` first
3. Max `2` second
4. Max `1` last

Use this only when your role/build is meant to convert personal damage, not pure frontline control.

## Core combos and sequences

## 1. Standard pick engage

1. `Blink Rune` (or flank walk)
2. `2` (`Confound`) immediately
3. `3` (`Shield Wall`) under taunted target
4. Passive basic (`Reach`) as taunt ends
5. `1` (`Preemptive Strike`) to chase/zone or disengage based on risk

## 2. Dash-first confirm

1. `1` into target line
2. Instant `2` as soon as range allows
3. `3` on top of controlled targets
4. Passive basic weave

## 3. Anti-dive peel chain

1. Hold `2` until diver commits to your carry
2. `2` taunt diver off the carry
3. `3` on your backline path (forces diver through slow + second hit)
4. `1` through diver for slow + self-protections, then bodyblock

## 4. Global countergank

1. `4` to ally under pressure
2. On landing, `2` highest-threat diver
3. `3` on landing zone
4. Passive basic + `1` to either secure or cut retreat

## 5. Aspect of War burst call

1. Cast enemy-targeted `4` (Aspect active)
2. Call focus during channel (enemy takes increased damage)
3. Land and chain `2` -> `3`
4. Use `1` to cut escape route rather than over-chasing

## Relic defaults (OB29 window)

## Conquest support default

- First relic default: `Phantom Shell`
- Second relic default: `Sundering Arc`

Why:
- `Phantom Shell` is the most common support relic signal in current Athena support snapshot data.
- `Sundering Arc` supports Athena's proactive objective and pick tempo.

## Common swaps

- `Purification Beads`: into hard-CC chains that prevent taunt/ult execution.
- `Blink Rune`: when your comp has immediate follow-up on taunt engages.
- `Aegis of Acceleration`: into burst windows where you get deleted before cooldown cycle completes.

## Current support snapshot signal (small sample)

`/gods/athena?role=support` (SmiteBrain, 2026-02-24 to 2026-02-25 window):
- `Phantom Shell` 47.6% pick rate
- `Sundering Arc` 23.8%
- `Purification Beads` 9.5%
- `Blink Rune` 9.5%

Sample size is small, so use this as directional signal, not absolute law.

## Positioning rules

- Play from side angles before fights. Front-center entries make your taunt path obvious and easier to pre-beads.
- Don't spend `1` early unless you already know your exit plan.
- Taunt value beats poke value. Hold `2` for priority targets, especially divers and carries without relics.
- In objective fights, prioritize zone control and secure denial over deep chase.
- After using global ult, stabilize formation first (peel/space), then re-engage.

## Mode notes

## Conquest

- Athena naturally fits Duo-side Support rotations and objective contests.
- Conquest is objective- and macro-heavy; Athena's global ult is strongest when used proactively for early collapse fights.
- Use taunt to deny enemy secure attempts around Gold Fury/Fire Giant windows.

## Arena

- Arena is ticket-driven, high-frequency teamfighting with level-3 starts.
- Athena should focus on repeat engage/peel cycles and clean ticket trades, not isolated chase paths.
- Open map makes channels and entries easier to read, so vary your angle/timing and avoid predictable straight-line starts.

## Joust

- Smaller map and faster engagements increase the value of instant control tools.
- Athena excels at forcing short-window picks with `2 -> 3` and then turning structure/objective pressure off that kill.
