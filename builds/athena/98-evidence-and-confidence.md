# Evidence and Confidence (Athena)

Date anchored: 2026-02-25

## Patch status

- Current official patch: OB29 - The Dark Enchantress Update
- Official publish timestamp: 2026-02-23T17:52:17.056Z
- No direct Athena kit/stat text found in OB27/OB28/OB29 official note payloads.

## Important data quality note

Public Athena build feeds are lagging behind the official patch window:
- SmiteSource Athena build index currently shows `Current Patch - OB28`.
- Because of that, OB29 recommendations should be treated as OB29-adjusted adaptations from OB28-labeled public builds plus official OB29 system context.

## Confidence model

- Tier 1 (highest): official SMITE 2 patch notes and official CMS payloads
- Tier 2: official SMITE 2 Wiki god/item mechanics
- Tier 3: SmiteSource build metadata and role/mode convergence
- Tier 4: SMITEFire and other community references

## What can be asserted safely

- Conquest Athena has strong frontline-support build shells that remain valid in the OB29 window.
- Arena recommendations are practical OB29-adjusted adaptations with medium confidence due sparse Athena-specific OB29-tagged public build cards.
- Athena itemization should prioritize engage reliability, cooldown flow, protections, and aura/team utility.

## What should not be asserted

- A single mathematically absolute best Athena build for every role, lobby, and skill bracket.
