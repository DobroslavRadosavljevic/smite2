# Conquest Build 03: Greedy Snowball Burst Variant

Confidence: 0.70 (Medium)

## Build identity

This is a tempo greed variant for games where you are ahead and can force repeated picks.
It cuts some safety to maximize chase and burst conversion.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Bumba's Golden Dagger
2. Axe
3. Gjallarflare
4. Health Potion
5. Blink Rune

## Core progression

1. Bumba's Spear
2. Arondight
3. Hydra's Lament
4. The Reaper
5. Heartseeker
6. Titan's Bane
7. Bloodforge

## Why this works

- Arondight boosts chase/reveal after commits.
- Reaper + Bloodforge improves kill-chain durability in snowball fights.
- Bumba's Spear keeps fast cycle aggression online.

## Playstyle plan

1. Force skirmishes around vision pockets and jungle corridors.
2. Prioritize enemy carries with weak mobility/relic windows.
3. Exit after first kill unless passive reset gives immediate second pick.

## Risk profile

- Higher variance than default build.
- If early tempo breaks, transition one slot into defense.

## Recovery swap

If game stabilizes and you are no longer ahead:
- Replace Bloodforge with The Crusher or a defense flex
- Replace Arondight with Jotunn's Revenge in long games
