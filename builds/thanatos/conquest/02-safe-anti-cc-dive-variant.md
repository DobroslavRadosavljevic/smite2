# Conquest Build 02: Safe Anti-CC Dive Variant

Confidence: 0.78 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

Use this when enemy teamfight control is the main reason your dives fail.
This variant trades some raw damage for more reliable entry and second rotation uptime.

## Full item order

## Start

1. Bumba's Cudgel
2. Axe
3. Bifrost Shard
4. Health Potion
5. Purification Beads

## Core progression

1. Jotunn's Revenge
2. Hydra's Lament
3. Heartseeker
4. Titan's Bane
5. Magi's Cloak
6. The Reaper
7. Upgrade Bumba's Cudgel -> Bumba's Hammer at level 20

Optional defensive flex:
- Spirit Robe instead of Reaper when chain CC is extreme

## Why this works

- You still keep the standard burst/pen spine.
- Early Beads + Magi's protects your first entry window.
- You reduce failed-engage losses and keep execute threat online.

## Playstyle plan

1. Hold engage until key hard-CC is shown.
2. Enter from side lane angles, not directly through supports.
3. Use ult for secure cleanup, not front-door initiation.
4. Disengage immediately if first silence/scythe misses.

## Common mistake with this build

- Overestimating your damage after adding defense; play as reset finisher, not main frontline.
