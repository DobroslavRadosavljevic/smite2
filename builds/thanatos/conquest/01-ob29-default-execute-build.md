# Conquest Build 01: OB29 Default Execute Build

Confidence: 0.85 (High)

## Build identity

This is the best-supported OB29 Conquest Jungle default for Thanatos.
It is built around:
- fast cooldown cycling
- high Strength burst
- anti-tank penetration timing
- kill-chain sustain

## Full item order

## Start

1. Bumba's Cudgel
2. Axe
3. Bifrost Shard
4. Health Potion
5. Blink Rune

## Core progression

1. Hydra's Lament
2. Jotunn's Revenge
3. Heartseeker
4. Titan's Bane
5. The Crusher
6. The Reaper
7. Upgrade Bumba's Cudgel -> Bumba's Hammer at level 20

## Why this works

- Hydra and Bumba reward ability -> basic weave patterns.
- Jotunn keeps ult and combo uptime high.
- Heartseeker + Titan's Bane keeps damage relevant into frontline.
- Crusher gives extra ability hit pressure.
- Reaper stabilizes extended skirmishes after first takedown.

## Playstyle plan

## Early game

1. Prioritize clean clear paths and fast level 5 timing.
2. Use 1 to force relics before all-in ult commits.
3. Avoid low-probability tower dives before first major item.

## Mid game

1. Play flank angles around objective fights.
2. Use ult mainly as execute confirm.
3. Chain passive cooldown resets into second target only if safe.

## Late game

1. Target carries who are already chipped or mispositioned.
2. Keep one defensive swap if enemy peel/CC is heavy.
3. Do not spend ult blindly into full relics and peel cooldowns.

## Good into

- squishy backlines
- comps with weak peel
- games where your team can follow on your first pick

## Weak into

- layered hard-CC comps
- hyper-tanky frontlines without early pen timing

## Fast adaptations

- Need anti-heal: swap The Crusher for Brawler's Beat Stick
- Need anti-CC: swap The Reaper for Magi's Cloak or Spirit Robe
- Need anti-burst: swap The Reaper for Shifter's Shield
