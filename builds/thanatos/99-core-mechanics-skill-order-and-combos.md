# Core Mechanics, Skill Orders, and Combos

## Why Thanatos itemization is specific

- Abilities cost health instead of mana.
- Passive grants healing on kill and cooldown reset on god kill.
- Kit scales heavily with Strength and rewards execute timing.
- Ability to basic-attack weaving is a major damage multiplier with Hydra/Bumba styles.

## Recommended skill orders

## Conquest default

1. Level ultimate whenever possible (5/9/13/17/20)
2. Max 1 first (Death Scythe)
3. Max 3 second (Soul Reap)
4. Max 2 last (Scent of Death)

Level 1-5 template:
- L1: 1
- L2: 2
- L3: 3
- L4: 1
- L5: 4

## Arena default

1. Level ultimate whenever possible
2. Max 3 first if you need teamfight control (silence pressure)
3. Max 1 second for execute setup poke and sustain
4. Max 2 last

Alternative Arena order for snowball:
- Max 1 before 3 if you are consistently landing scythes and converting kills.

## Core combos

## Pick combo (safe)

1. Activate 2 (Scent of Death)
2. Land 1 (Death Scythe)
3. Close and cast 3 (Soul Reap)
4. Weave a basic attack
5. Hold ult for execute confirm

## Full commit combo

1. Activate 2
2. Blink in (if available)
3. 3 for silence
4. Basic attack weave
5. 1 to finish setup
6. Ult to execute or force disengage

## Reset chain rule

After any god kill:
- Immediately re-evaluate cooldowns from passive reset
- If 1 or 3 returns in time, look for second target
- If no quick second cast window, disengage and reset positioning

## Relic defaults

- Blink Rune: default engage tool
- Purification Beads: into hard-CC chain comps
- Aegis path: into high burst when you are getting deleted on entry

## Common mistakes

- Burning ult for opener when execute is not guaranteed.
- Front-to-back pathing into peel instead of flanking.
- Spamming health-cost abilities before fight starts.
- Not weaving basic attacks when running Hydra/Bumba builds.
