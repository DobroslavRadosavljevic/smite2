## Patch status

- Current official patch: OB29 - The Dark Enchantress Update
- Official publish timestamp: 2026-02-23T17:52:17.056Z
- No direct Thanatos kit/stat changes found in OB29 notes.

## Confidence model

- Tier 1 (highest): official SMITE 2 patch notes and official CMS payloads
- Tier 2: SMITE 2 Wiki god/item mechanics
- Tier 3: SmiteSource build metadata and patch tags
- Tier 4: SMITEFire and other community build context

## What can be asserted safely

- Conquest has a strong best-supported default shell on OB29.
- Arena recommendations are OB29-adjusted and evidence-backed, but not mathematically absolute.
- Thanatos remains a burst execute reset assassin whose itemization should prioritize Strength, cooldown flow, and penetration timing.
