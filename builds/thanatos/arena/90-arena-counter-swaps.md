# Arena Counter Swaps

## Swap order rule

Arena replacement order:
- Slot 6 -> Slot 5

In Arena, shift counters earlier than Conquest because fights are more frequent and less reset-friendly.

## Matchup matrix

| Enemy problem | Swap in | Swap out first |
|---|---|---|
| Heavy healing | Brawler's Beat Stick, Contagion | The Crusher or Bloodforge |
| Double tank | Titan's Bane earlier, Heartseeker lock | Bloodforge |
| Crit carry threat | Spectral Armor, Hide of the Nemean Lion | Bloodforge |
| Hard-CC chain | Purification Beads, Magi's Cloak, Spirit Robe | Bloodforge or The Crusher |
| Burst delete comps | Shifter's Shield, Prophetic Cloak, Aegis path | Bloodforge |

## Arena-specific micro rules

1. If you die before second spell cycle twice in a row, buy defense immediately.
2. If enemy healing is winning sustained fights, anti-heal by item 2-3.
3. If backline is unreachable, pivot to anti-frontline plus reset play.
