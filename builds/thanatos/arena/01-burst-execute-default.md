# Arena Build 01: Burst Execute Default (OB29-adjusted)

Confidence: 0.78 (Medium-High)

## Build identity

This is the best-supported Arena adaptation for OB29 when you want standard assassin execution.
It keeps the proven Thanatos burst spine and adjusts starter/flex logic for non-Conquest fights.

## Start options

## Aggressive start

1. Bumba's Cudgel
2. Axe
3. Health Potion
4. Blink Rune

## Safer Arena start

1. Sundering Axe
2. Axe/Shield component based on lane pressure
3. Health Potion
4. Blink Rune or Beads

## Core progression

1. Hydra's Lament
2. Jotunn's Revenge
3. Heartseeker
4. Titan's Bane
5. The Crusher
6. The Reaper (or Tyrfing flex)

If you started Bumba, upgrade to Bumba's Hammer at level 20.

## Why this works

- Arena still rewards immediate pick threat and execute confirms.
- Hydra/Jotunn/Heartseeker/Titan remains the highest-signal damage shell.
- Crusher and Reaper give pressure + sustain for frequent skirmishes.

## Playstyle plan

## Early arena phase

1. Play side angles and avoid centerline hard-CC traffic.
2. Use 1 to chip and create execute pressure, not random all-ins.
3. Force relics before committing ult.

## Mid arena phase

1. Track enemy beads/aegis timers and target no-relic carries.
2. Enter after first wave of enemy peel is spent.
3. Convert one kill into immediate team reposition, not deep chase.

## Late arena phase

1. Value survival and clean confirms over highlight dives.
2. Prioritize targets that can immediately swing ticket pressure.
3. Save relic for guaranteed follow-through, not panic usage.
