# Arena Build 02: Sustain Skirmisher Variant

Confidence: 0.64 (Medium)

## Build identity

Use this when fights are long and you need stronger re-entry durability after first contact.

## Full item order

1. Sundering Axe or Bumba's Spear
2. Hydra's Lament
3. The Reaper
4. Heartseeker
5. Titan's Bane
6. Jotunn's Revenge
7. Bloodforge

Relic default:
- Beads if hard-CC chains are frequent
- Blink if you still have safe flank access

## Why this works

- Reaper and Bloodforge stabilize post-kill uptime in chained fights.
- Heartseeker/Titan keeps tank damage relevant.
- Jotunn still supports frequent ability cycles in long brawls.

## Playstyle plan

1. Fight in two waves: first commit to force cooldowns, second commit to execute.
2. Use ult mostly as finisher when enemies are already chunked.
3. If first ability chain misses, reset immediately and wait for next entry.

## When not to use

- Enemy comp has low sustain and you can end fights instantly.
- You need earlier anti-CC/anti-burst slot more than sustain.
