# Arena Build 03: Bruiser Tankatos Variant

Confidence: 0.51 (Medium-Low)

## Build identity

This is a niche teamfight durability setup for lobbies where full assassin Thanatos gets deleted before second rotation.

## Full item order

1. Sundering Axe
2. Prophetic Cloak
3. Berserker's Shield
4. Golden Blade
5. Runeforged Hammer
6. Gladiator's Shield
7. Flex slot: Heartseeker or Titan's Bane (if damage is too low)

Relic preference:
- Beads first into hard-CC
- Aegis path into heavy burst

## Why this works

- Frontloaded protections and sustain let you survive first contact.
- You trade peak execute burst for consistent fight presence.
- Flex damage slot keeps you from becoming ignorable.

## Playstyle plan

1. Enter with your frontline, not as isolated flank diver.
2. Use 3 silence to disrupt enemy carries and mages.
3. Ult is mostly for high-value confirm, not first engage.
4. Peel back to your team after first cast cycle unless kill is guaranteed.

## Risk profile

- Lower carry potential than burst variants.
- Can lose games if your team needs hard backline deletion and you cannot provide it.
